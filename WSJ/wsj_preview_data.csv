Wall Stree Journal,"President Trump denounced as “a hoax” reports that Russia paid bounties for attacks on American soldiers, while administration officials said he may yet pursue talks with Moscow through international organizations such as the Group of Seven leading nations.Republican as well as Democratic lawmakers continued calling for briefings on U.S. intelligence indicating that Russia’s military intelligence agency, commonly known as the GRU, was paying Taliban insurgents to attack U.S. service members in Afghanistan. The Central Intelligence Agency is due to brief House lawmakers on the issue Thursday.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday that if reports about the intelligence are true, it represents “a serious escalation.”“It demands a strong response, and I don’t mean a diplomatic response,” he said. “Putin is a KGB guy who only understands strength.”Mr. Trump, in an interview on Fox Business Network on Wednesday, said the intelligence was never presented to him because it “didn’t rise to that level.”“I think it’s a hoax,” he said. “I think it’s a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats.”At the same time, he acknowledged the information was contained in intelligence reports, although he said: “Many of the intelligence people didn’t think it was something that even happened.”A U.S. intelligence assessment about the alleged scheme was included earlier this year as part of information presented to Mr. Trump in his daily intelligence briefing materials. The White House has said that Mr. Trump was never briefed in person on the intelligence and that the intelligence presented was unverified.Related VideoPutin’s 20 Years in Charge and What Could Be His Biggest Test YetDuring more than 20 years in power, Vladimir Putin has faced a number of challenges while pushing to expand Russia’s influence. But the coronavirus pandemic might be the biggest test to his leadership yet, as he moves to possibly extend his presidency until 2036.

The differences weren’t over the central assessment that operatives with the GRU paid bounties to the insurgent Taliban movement to kill Americans, some of the people said.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday questioned the accuracy of media coverage of the bounty program, declining to comment on the intelligence while saying it had been handled appropriately by the administration.“The fact that the Russians are engaged in Afghanistan, in a way that’s adverse to the United States, is nothing new,” he said, adding that he regularly raises the issue of Afghanistan with Russian officials.U.S. officials have said previously that Russia has backed the Taliban, including through small-arms shipments. Mr. Pompeo said Mr. Trump “has been consistently aware of the challenges that Russia presents to us, and he is aware of the risk in Afghanistan.”Mr. Trump said in May that as the host of this year’s summit of G-7 leaders he wants to invite Russia and other nations to take part in the meeting, which has been delayed. Several allied leaders opposed the plan to invite Russia in light of its 2014 invasion of Ukraine.Mr. Pompeo said that the administration needs to speak to the Russians and that Mr. Trump will make his own determination about Russia’s possible participation in the coming G-7 summit in the U.S.“The president gets to decide if he wants them to come to summits or not,” Mr. Pompeo said. “That’s his decision. I’ll certainly leave that to him. But I do believe it is absolutely important that we have more frequent engagement with the Russians.”Mr. Trump’s denunciation of the intelligence in the televised interview Wednesday came hours after he tweeted a similar thought, calling news reports an effort to “slander me & the Republican Party.”His lawyer Rudy Giuliani decried revelations of the intelligence information in comments to reporters outside the White House on Wednesday.“It’s some kind of a felon in the federal government, some kind of a deep state criminal, because he committed a very serious crime,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I don’t care what it reveals, and what it revealed is something that’s in dispute.”Write to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com and Courtney McBride at courtney.mcbride@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-denounces-russia-bounty-intelligence-as-hoax-11593646757
Wall Stree Journal,"Seattle police on Wednesday dismantled the self-styled Capitol Hill Organized Protest area, ending a three-week standoff between officers and protesters who had declared it a police-free zone.Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan issued an executive order early Wednesday morning for protesters to vacate the zone, known as CHOP.“It was clear many individuals would not leave,” the mayor said in a Wednesday afternoon news conference. “Public safety could not improve until they did leave.”She vowed to continue pushing for reforms the protesters had sought, such as less money for police and more for community programs.Seattle police said they made three dozen arrests in the zone for failure to disperse, obstruction, resisting arrest and assault. Police said one of those arrested, a 29-year-old man, was in possession of a large metal pipe and kitchen knife when he was taken into custody.Ms. Durkan issued an emergency proclamation for the East Precinct and Cal Anderson Park area, calling the police-free zone an “unlawful assembly.” The progressive mayor once predicted a “summer of love” in the zone.In the order, the mayor said the city’s obligations under the First Amendment didn’t require it to provide “limitless sanctuary to occupy city property, damage city and private property, obstruct the right of way or foster dangerous conditions.”“This order, and our police response, comes after weeks of violence in and around the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest zone, including four shootings, resulting in multiple injuries and the deaths of two teenagers,” Chief Carmen Best said in a statement.The Seattle police chief said CHOP had become “lawless and brutal.” At the press conference with the mayor, the chief said she walked through the neighborhood and was”stunned” by the amount of graffiti, garbage and property destruction left behind.People were coming out of their homes and apartments and thanking officers profusely,” Ms. Best said.The mayor’s decision to retake the area was inevitable, and should serve as a cautionary lesson to other big-city leaders to never agree to “absurd” demands, said Eugene O’Donnell, a professor of law and police studies at Manhattan’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan issued an emergency proclamation for the East Precinct and Cal Anderson Park area, calling the police-free zone an ‘unlawful assembly.’PHOTO: ELAINE THOMPSON/ASSOCIATED PRESS“You can’t run a government based on how loud people are shouting,” said Mr. O’Donnell, a former New York City police officer and prosecutor.U.S. Attorney General William Barr said, “The people of Seattle should be grateful to Chief Best and her department for their professional and steadfast defense of the rule of law.” However, he did not single out the mayor for praise. Her handling of the situation has drawn widespread criticism, including from President Trump.When asked Wednesday about Mr. Barr’s comments and the criticism, the mayor said“I would urge the administration to restore lawfulness to Pennsylvania Avenue.”Some blamed Seattle police for creating the conditions that led to CHOP in the first place, such as by repeatedly firing tear gas at them during standoffs that took place following the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, while he was in Minneapolis police custody.“This fueled anger,” said a tweet by a group called Seattle Black Collective Voice, which assisted in the occupation. The group also said the first CHOP campers actually stayed to protect the police building, “so protesters couldn’t be framed for damage and a fire wouldn’t spread to adjacent residential buildings.”Besides the deaths, Ms. Durkan said crime in general had soared inside the occupied zone. It encompassed six city blocks from the Cal Anderson sports park, where many protesters had camped, to the East Precinct police station, where they held nightly demonstrations, dance parties and sometimes street barbecues.In all, major crimes so far this year jumped to 65 reported incidents in the CHOP census zone—most in the past month—from 37 for all of last year, according to a national database that Seattle police cited. Aggravated assaults rose to 11 this year from two last year, while robberies grew to six from none.The increase in crime was aided, in large part, by the inability of police to access the area, say people who live and work there. In the early days of the occupation, workers apprehended a burglar with tools and cash in the Car Tender auto repair shop, but a mob of demonstrators broke through a fence to free him after the business was unable to get police to respond, said co-owner John McDermott.“We have felt abandoned by the City Council and the governor,” said Mr. McDermott, who estimates his shop’s revenues fell 40% as a result of customers being afraid to come in.EarlierInside Seattle’s ‘Autonomous Zone’Following violent clashes with Seattle police, Black Lives Matter protesters have occupied a police-free zone in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood while they negotiate with local officials.

The action infuriated the mayor, who said her address was supposed to be kept confidential under a state protection program because of death threats she has received for her previous work as U.S. attorney in Seattle. She blamed Councilwoman Kshama Sawant, a self-described socialist, for orchestrating the march and asked the City Council to investigate her for any violations of office.

Wall Stree Journal,"Safety fixes after the first Boeing Co. 737 MAX crash became snarled in Federal Aviation Administration delays and repetitive analyses, wasting any chance U.S. regulators had to prevent the second fatal accident, according to an investigation by the Transportation Department’s internal watchdog.The 52-page report released Wednesday reiterated previously known lapses by the FAA and Boeing during initial safety approval of the MAX, but it also raised additional questions about the seeming lack of urgency both sides displayed during the five months between the two crashes to develop and implement a safety fix covering the entire fleet.Following the first MAX crash, in October 2018, it took the FAA four months just to agree on a timetable for implementing fixes once they were devised, according to the report by the DOT inspector general.The narrative released Wednesday also revealed that FAA officials spent months conducting an inconclusive internal review of problems with the plane’s original certification. Launched in January of 2019, the review got bogged down in bureaucratic procedures, never got finished and eventually was abandoned when a second MAX went down that March, according to the inspector general.The inspector general’s report provides fresh ammunition for FAA critics in Congress who argue agency officials wasted their chance to act swiftly and decisively to prevent the second, similar MAX crash that occurred less than five months later.RELATED ARTICLESFAA to Start Boeing 737 MAX Test Flights (June 28)Panel Clears 737 MAX’s Safety-Approval Process at FAA (June 16)An FAA spokesman declined to comment.The document offers new insights about precisely how long it took the FAA to chart a course to deal with safety problems after Lion Air Flight 610 nosedived into the Java Sea in the autumn of 2018. The inspector general also lays out, in more detail than previous reports, the agency’s subsequent halting progress coming to grips with the MAX fleet’s hazards in the period that ended with the fatal crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019.A Boeing spokesman said that since the accidents, “we have made substantial changes within our company to further enhance our commitment to safety.” Boeing, the spokesman continued, has pledged “transparency with the FAA during all aspects of the airplane certification process.”Relatives of crash victims gathered at an anniversary memorial service this past March to remember those who died when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed.PHOTO: MULUGETA AYENE/ASSOCIATED PRESSThe latest scrutiny adds yet more voices to the extensive chorus of U.S. lawmakers and global safety experts who have pinpointed Boeing’s failures, extending back to the development of the MAX, to provide timely and accurate information about an automated flight-control feature known as MCAS. Misfires of that system led to both crashes, which took a total of 346 lives and plunged Boeing into what was then the worst crisis in its 100-plus year history, until the Covid-19 pandemic.The report doesn’t offer recommendations. In a formal response to the inspector general’s report, Steven Bradbury, the DOT’s general counsel, wrote that it revealed “some strengths in FAA’s aircraft certification process, as well as areas for improvement.”Safety vetting of the MAX before its 2017 introduction into service, according to Mr. Bradbury’s memo, which was attached to the report, “was hampered by a lack of effective communication, both between Boeing and FAA and within FAA,” resulting in the agency receiving incomplete information about MCAS hazards before approving the plane for passenger service.Related VideoInside the Boeing Scandal That Rocked the Aviation IndustryBoeing’s two 737 MAX crashes and the investigation that followed ruined not just the aircraft manufacturer’s reputation but also its bottom line. WSJ’s aviation reporters break down how the scandal unfolded and explain what the flying public can expect in the future. Photo: Gary He/EPA-EFE (Originally published March 9, 2020)Wednesday’s report chronicles how, over the four years leading up to the FAA’s green light for the MAX to carry passengers, the agency increasingly delegated safety approvals to Boeing experts authorized to act on the agency’s behalf. In the end, Boeing took the lead on all of the 91 designated certification projects for the MAX. The document also indicates that throughout the process, the Seattle plane maker sought to play down the importance of MCAS. During one early technical meeting with the FAA, the inspector general determined, only two lines of text referred to MCAS as part of a two-day, 482-slide Boeing presentation highlighting new features on the jet.The report also indicates that after changing the design of MCAS in 2016 to make it substantially more powerful, Boeing didn’t provide information outlining the change to FAA engineers.The report indicates the FAA didn’t finish its official assessment of safety hazards posed by the MAX fleet until Dec. 12, 2018, almost two full months after the Lion Air crash. But according to the inspector general, it wasn’t until the second week in January that the agency for the first time “performed its own detailed analysis of MCAS.”That January date, several FAA engineers told the inspector general’s staff, also was the “first time that they were presented with a full picture of how MCAS worked.”Then it took another month, until the middle of February, for the FAA and Boeing to agree on a schedule for implementing fixes to MCAS’s problematic software.The FAA’s internal review of what went wrong with the initial certification process was still in draft form when the Ethiopian jet crashed in March and the 737 MAX fleet was grounded globally. At that point, according to the inspector general, the agency shelved the document since it had been “overtaken by events.”The inspector general’s timeline conflicts with what high-ranking Boeing engineers and other company officials told some airline pilots in late 2018 about the anticipated speed of the pending fixes. At the end of November 2018, company representatives told leaders of the pilot union at American Airlines Group Inc. that “relatively straightforward software changes” to MCAS were slated to be released in a company bulletin in roughly six weeks, or about mid-January, according to an audio recording of the meeting that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.By the time the January target had passed, according to the inspector general, the FAA and Boeing didn’t expect the software fix to be ready until April of 2019.Now, after more than a year of additional delays and expanded scrutiny of other flight-computer and cockpit-alert features, besides MCAS, software and hardware fixes to the MAX fleet are expected to be approved by this fall.Boeing and FAA pilots Wednesday wrapped up three days of crucial test flights, putting a MAX through sharp turns and steep dives to verify flight-control software and associated systems, though the results won’t be summarized, assessed or released for some time.Calling the flights “an important milestone,” the FAA Wednesday reiterated that a number key tasks remain and it is “following a deliberate process and will take the time it needs to thoroughly review Boeing’s work.”Wednesday’s report goes beyond earlier findings released in March of this year by Democrats on the House Transportation Committee, which pinpointed some squandered opportunities by the FAA to prevent the second crash. The committee’s report said that in December 2018, agency officials “received a briefing from Boeing that should have raised additional red flags” about the thoroughness of the plane maker’s initial safety assessments regarding MCAS hazards.On Wednesday, Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the Democratic chairman of the House transportation panel, issued a news release saying “the more scrutiny we put on Boeing and the FAA, and the more we dig into why and how the system failed so horribly,” the better chance “we have of fixing the system to ensure no family has to endure this nightmare again.”—Alison Sider contributed to this article.Corrections & AmplificationsThe first fatal accident of a Boeing Co. 737 MAX was in October 2018.

George Floyd protest in Washington, DC, USA - 31 May 2020 Published Credit: jim lo scalzo/EPA/ShutterstockPHOTO: JIM LO SCALZO/EPA/SHUTTERSTOCKThe American public is fractured over policy responses to Covid-19. That rift is most visible in debates about masks and new rounds of shutdowns. Such disputes are common in a country as diverse and opinionated as America. But political leaders and health officials have sown distrust by politicizing the pandemic response.Political leaders and health officials have often invoked “science” to justify decisions manifestly guided by their personal preferences. That costs them credibility. Restoring public confidence will require acknowledging their role in politicizing the pandemic, yielding to accommodations and sensible alternatives in the areas of greatest controversy, and focusing on the widely supported goal of not overwhelming hospitals, rather than less meaningful metrics such as increases in Covid-19 cases.One of the earliest signs of politicization was the broad animus directed at protesters who objected to the lockdowns. In a country where liberty and free expression are as fundamental as air and water, it is remarkable how casually political leaders and health officials disparaged and banned their activities—and even targeted protesters for prosecution. Politics was also at play when New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered police in Brooklyn to break up a crowd of mourners who gathered for a Hasidic Jewish funeral, warning that their actions were “unacceptable” and threatening to arrest them.Contrast this with the approach that many of the same political leaders and public-health experts took toward the protests catalyzed by George Floyd’s killing. These protesters were neither maligned nor targeted with fines and arrests based on social distancing or mask mandates. They were often joined in the streets by politicians such as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy.The double standard in treatment was political. All these public gatherings were led by people expressing sincerely held beliefs that they felt outweighed the risk of Covid-19 transmission. Protecting such expression, regardless of viewpoint, is fundamental to the integrity of a democracy. Instead, politicians played favorites with this core American tenet.ILLUSTRATION: DAVID GOTHARDMedical experts have also lost the empathy that previously characterized their approach to public health. Many illnesses spread as a result of personal decisions and behavior. The contemporary consensus in the medical community has been to acknowledge—without judgment—that preferences and circumstances of individuals vary. This has been true even when individual decisions affect the health of others. This is why public-health experts advocate pre-exposure prophylaxis antiretrovirals for HIV prevention, needle-exchange programs for drug users, and, in the U.K., e-cigarettes for smoking cessation.But this wisdom hasn’t been afforded to the Covid-19 pandemic. There is little accommodation for people who avoid masks because of difficulty breathing, claustrophobia or the belief that one’s face shouldn’t be subject to public policing. Some medical ethicists have suggested that if ventilators are in short supply, patients who religiously used masks and adhered to social distancing should receive priority—rationing medical care to punish noncompliance.Further corroding public trust was health officials’ reversal about wearing masks. In February, they discouraged their use and told the public there was no evidence they were effective. Yet when questioned by Rep. David McKinley (R., W.Va.) on June 23, Anthony Fauci claimed the initial guidance was motivated by concerns about medical supply shortages—not doubts about mask effectiveness. No wonder many Americans don’t trust the calls to wear masks.If political leaders and health experts want to restore their credibility and the public’s confidence, they need to begin by acknowledging that politics rather than science has influenced important public-health decisions and by making accommodations for dissenting perspectives. Alternatives to masks, for instance, include physical distancing and using face shields while indoors.And while there is more to learn about immunity, there has not been a single confirmed case of reinfection among the 10 million cases of Covid-19 world-wide, according to a May report in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Until the data say otherwise, people who have recovered from Covid-19 should be exempt from restrictions.The most important step political leaders and health officials can take is to base their decisions on hospital capacity, rather than case counts, which inevitably will continue to increase among low-risk young people. Policing of social distance and restrictions on personal, educational and business activities are fueling culture wars. Focusing on the goal of not overwhelming hospitals is sensible and less vulnerable to politicization—so long as the data are publicly available for independent analysis. Hospitals often run near capacity to maximize profits, so the promises made during shutdowns to increase capacity need to be fulfilled—or capacity will become a political weapon.Since citizens are already opting out of high-risk activities they want to avoid, let them enter bars, enjoy the beach, exercise at the gym, and learn in school if they choose. The government should intervene with mandates and closures only if regional hospital capacity requires it, while being transparent about bed availability, illness severity of hospitalized patients, and efforts to increase treatment capacity, including the supply of promising medications such as remdesivir and dexamethasone.These steps would make the struggle against Covid-19 more sustainable and less politicized. Less petty squabbling and wasting of resources would mean more attention for strategies to protect the most vulnerable Americans.Dr. Ladapo is an associate professor at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine.Opinion: The Coming Urban ExodusWonder Land: After months of the pandemic, protests and failing progressive leadership, many are going to move out of U.S. centers.

Wall Stree Journal,"Protesters making gestures of 1 and 5 fingers, symbolising the five demands of the protest movement during the demonstration in Hong Kong, July 1.PHOTO: WILLIE SIAWILLIE SIAU/ZUMA PRESSChina’s decision to impose its national-security law on Hong Kong is a seismic event that goes well beyond the sad fate of its 7.5 million people. The illegal takeover shows that Beijing’s Communist rulers are willing to violate their international commitments with impunity as they spread their authoritarian model.We say this with regret because we were among those who hoped, amid China’s reform era that began in the 1980s, that the Middle Kingdom could be drawn into a world of peaceful global norms. Hong Kong, a showcase of the prosperity that economic freedom and the rule of law can produce, was a lesson for Beijing to learn from.OPINION: POTOMAC WATCHD.C. Statehood; A Win for School Choicebb0282a3-e4cb-42ba-9988-2f3df57fd912@1.00xCreated with sketchtool.00:001xSUBSCRIBENow those hopes are crushed, as China’s Communist legislature imposed the national-security law that ends Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” governance and subverts the rights promised under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984. Beijing promised to preserve Hong Kong’s legal autonomy and freedom of speech, assembly, the press and other liberties. The 7.5 million now subject to this sweeping legislation weren’t even permitted to read the text until it passed.In a statement Tuesday, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam claimed that the national-security law “only targets an extremely small minority of offenders while the life and property as well as various legitimate basic rights and freedoms enjoyed by the overwhelming majority of citizens will be protected.”The Hong Kong people clearly don’t believe her because thousands took to the streets Wednesday to protest, despite the personal risks under the new law. More than 300 were arrested, including several under the new security law.The legislation also outlaws secessionism, subversion, “terrorist activities” and “collusion” with foreign forces, all defined so broadly that nearly anything but unconditional obedience to Beijing may be deemed illegal. It also forbids “provoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents towards the Central People’s Government or the Government of the Region, which is likely to cause serious consequences.” The maximum punishment is life in prison.The obvious targets include prominent figures like democracy advocates Martin Lee, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, and publisher Jimmy Lai. But Beijing also makes clear that anyone who participates in protests or otherwise speaks out against the Communist Party could face charges. A Hong Konger who advocates for democracy at a U.S. university or meets with Members of Congress runs the risk of arrest upon return.The law also allows authorities to go after foreigners, including for speech or activities that take place outside Hong Kong. Journalists, human-rights activists and businessmen now visit or work in the city at their peril.The law doesn’t explicitly say if the accused can be extradited to the mainland. But that is meaningless since the measure effectively brings mainland justice to Hong Kong. Security forces who answer to Beijing will collect intelligence and surveil suspects. Beijing chooses which judges can hear national-security cases and claims exclusive authority to interpret the new law.All of this is also ominous for Taiwan, whose free people will be even less likely to trust Beijing’s assurances after watching Hong Kong’s fate. Taiwan’s foreign minister condemned the new security law, and some of Hong Kong's people may seek refuge on the island. A Beijing mouthpiece warned about a Taiwanese “black hand” in Hong Kong affairs, and a Chinese military intervention can’t be ruled out.The British, to their credit, have responded to all of this by offering some three million Hong Kongers the right to reside in the U.K. on a path to citizenship. The U.S. should do the same, and bipartisan bills in Congress are moving to offer refugee status to some Hong Kongers. President Trump should welcome these talented freedom lovers with open arms in what promises to be a long competition between democracy and Chinese Communism.For now, however, a beacon of freedom has been extinguished, and the world should learn that it can’t trust Beijing’s promises.Opinion: You Say You Want a Revolution?Wonder Land: The benchmark for American revolt remains the Declaration of Independence signed on July 4, 1776.

Wall Stree Journal,"Senator Sheldon Whitehouse on June 11.PHOTO: POOL/REUTERSRhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse makes a habit of accusing his opponents of corruption. So let’s take a look at an example of the Senator’s political mediation that Mr. Whitehouse would surely denounce if the facts involved someone he disliked.The details come courtesy of Americans for Public Trust, a nonprofit that has examined the Senator’s relationship with Utilidata, Inc., a Providence-based green energy company. In January 2014, Mr. Whitehouse hosted Utilidata’s then CEO, Scott DePasquale, as his guest at President Obama’s State of the Union Address. He lauded Mr. DePasquale as a “RI energy efficiency leader” in a press release.OPINION: POTOMAC WATCHD.C. Statehood; A Win for School Choicebb0282a3-e4cb-42ba-9988-2f3df57fd912@1.00xCreated with sketchtool.00:001xSUBSCRIBEIn 2015, according to Federal Election Commission records, Mr. DePasquale and two other top Utilidata executives, Carl J. Meiser and Josh Brumberger, gave $3,000 combined to the Whitehouse for Senate campaign.On April 18, 2016, the Providence Journalreported that as the federal government prepared “to aggressively ramp up its funding of clean-energy research to help address climate change,” Mr. Whitehouse co-hosted a roundtable with then-Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz to discuss clean energy. Utilidata’s Mr. Brumberger was among the participants.Mr. Brumberger mentioned that “fifty people in Providence, Rhode Island, worked together for three months on a grant application to DOE to explore security and technology being discussed in the roundtable,” according to a Department of Energy report on “exploring regional opportunities in the U.S. for clean energy technology innovation” that was issued in October 2016.Americans for Public Trust made a freedom of information request to the Department of Energy. The records it received show that on April 26, 2016, Mr. Whitehouse wrote to thank Mr. Moniz for his “participation in the clean technology roundtable with Rhode Island Stakeholders.”And in April 28, 2016, correspondence, according to a DOE summary released to Americans for Public Trust, Mr. Whitehouse wrote “in support of Utilidata, Inc’s application to the United States Department of Energy Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems Grant Program.”Mr. DePasquale, who no longer works at Utilidata, didn’t respond to our inquiry. Theresa Gilbert, a spokeswoman for Utilidata, declined to elaborate on the contract the company was seeking or its interactions with Mr. Whitehouse. She added that the company “never received any grant or funding from the Department of Energy” and she says claims of a quid pro quo are “false.”Mr. Whitehouse declined to explain his intervention for Utilidata. His press secretary said in an email that “we assume that your wildly off-base request is something you were put up to by the polluters and dark-money political forces Senator Whitehouse routinely calls out, and for whom you routinely flack, and the Senator declines to get drawn into their little scheme.” She did not dispute the facts.***Why does this matter? Well, the Senate Ethics Manual puts the issue this way: “Because Senators occupy a position of public trust, every Senator always must endeavor to avoid the appearance that the Senator, the Senate, or the governmental process may be influenced by campaign contributions or other benefits provided by those with significant legislative or governmental interests.”Americans for Public Trust says Mr. Whitehouse “appears to have done just that” in his dealings with Utilidata.Former Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell was driven from office and convicted of a crime for doing favors for a political donor before the Supreme Court overturned his conviction. New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez was indicted for lobbying the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of a campaign donor, though prosecutors dropped the charges after the High Court’s McDonnell ruling that raised the standard for quid-pro-quo corruption.Meanwhile, Mr. Whitehouse accuses companies, judges and others of corruption on an almost daily basis without any evidence. He claims the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has a “stunning record of partisan judicial activism,” which he says is bought and paid for by “dark money” donors.This month he smeared federal appellate Judge Neomi Rao for her opinion supporting Michael Flynn’s request for a writ of mandamus to dismiss his case: “‘Judge’ Rao delivers the coverup she was put on the court for.” Never mind that her opinion was joined by Judge Karen Henderson. Was she part of a coverup too?Mr. Whitehouse’s smears are based on less evidence than the facts of his favors for Utilidata and the contributions the company’s executives delivered to his campaign. The Senate Ethics Committee should open an investigation.Opinion: Hits and Misses of the WeekJournal Editorial Report: The week's best and worst from Kim Strassel, Bill McGurn and Dan Henninger.

Wall Stree Journal,"Representative Peter DeFazio speaks at the unveiling of H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, a plan to rebuild America's infrastructure, Washington, D.C., June 18.PHOTO: MICHAEL BROCHSTEIN/ZUMA PRESSHouse Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio hailed the $1.5 trillion infrastructure spending bill that House Democrats passed on Wednesday as “the application of the principles of the Green New Deal.” Ok, then, let’s see what’s inside the party pack.The bill includes a feast of pork including renewable energy storage tax credits, grants for public school weatherization and solar panels in low-income housing and electric-car charging stations. It’s a subsidy-fest for any industry that calls itself green.But perhaps more notable is what was kept out—a committee amendment to the bill by GOP Rep. Pete Stauber of Minnesota that Democrats quietly deleted before it came up for a floor vote. The amendment, which the Transportation Committee approved last week 43-19, would have required the Commerce Secretary to certify that federally funded electric buses and charging stations do not use minerals mined or processed with child labor. All 19 opponents were Democrats.Electric vehicle batteries include significant amounts of cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, manganese and rare earth elements. According to the amendment, the top producer of cobalt is the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which UNICEF and Amnesty International estimate employs 40,000 children in mines for up to 12 hours a day at wages of less than $2 a day. Some minerals are also mined in countries that exploit child labor like Zambia and Zimbabwe. This is one of the dirty little secrets of clean energy.Democrats and unions have demanded that corporations, especially textile manufacturers, certify that their supply chains don’t source materials produced with child labor. Yet now they oppose requiring the federal government to do the same when funding renewable energy.Last week, Mr. DeFazio substituted a manager’s amendment to the bill that removed Mr. Stauber’s amendment. The manager’s amendment says that “it is the policy of the United States” that funds “should not be used to purchase products produced whole or in part through the use of child labor,” but includes no enforcement mechanism.The Oregon Democrat claimed Mr. Stauber’s amendment was unnecessary since U.S. trade agreements prohibit child labor. But we have no agreement with Congo or Zimbabwe. China, which processes most minerals, hasn’t removed child labor from its supply chains. Mr. DeFazio knows that certification would therefore be impossible, but some progressive principles have to give when you’re trying to save the Earth from the evils of fossil fuels.Opinion: Smiley Face LiberalismWonder Land: The collapse of liberal elites under a leftist offensive has been in the making since the 'Summer of Love.'

Wall Stree Journal,"Pedestrians walk to the edge of the sidewalk to avoid stepping on people in tents and sleeping bags in the Tenderloin area of San Francisco on April 13.PHOTO: BEN MARGOT/ASSOCIATED PRESSSan Francisco was the first U.S. city to lock down and strictly enforce its shelter-in-place order—at least against law-abiding citizens. Meanwhile, public officials and police let hundreds of the homeless crowd streets and use drugs in the downtown Tenderloin district, according to two new lawsuits against the city.San Francisco’s homeless population increased by 20% between 2015 and 2019 but has surged since the city locked down in March. “The number of tents and makeshift shelters on Tenderloin sidewalks grew from 158 on March 3, 2020, to 391 on May 1, 2020,” one lawsuit notes. “However, the San Francisco Police Department has been directed not to remove or disturb those tents” even though “they block the sidewalks and shield criminals.”The lawsuit includes pictures of people camping out and crowding sidewalks this spring. One worker deemed essential by the city claims she had to walk in street traffic because sidewalks were strewn with tents, human feces and trash. Businesses in the neighborhood say they have been vandalized.According to the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, “students who decline offers of admission to Hastings often cite the neighborhood as a significant factor in their decisions.” One applicant wrote: “My family was harassed and approached by a drug dealer when walking around the campus. I could not imagine attending school in a place where this is a daily occurrence.”Meanwhile, as a recent article in City Journal notes, San Francisco is “surreptitiously placing homeless people in luxury hotels by designating them as emergency front-line workers” and has spent $3,795.98 to buy guests alcohol, ostensibly to encourage them to shelter in place. The city has also provided complimentary cigarettes and marijuana.Crime and drug use have increased around the hotels. Perhaps these entrepreneurs have discovered they can make a handsome profit reselling taxpayer-funded goods. Meantime, San Francisco police have cited ordinary citizens for violating the shelter-in-place order, including an 86-year-old protesting outside a Planned Parenthood clinic. George Floyd protesters have been exempt from enforcement.So far 50 people in San Francisco have died of Covid-19. During the first six months of last year, 182 people died of drug overdoses. The lawsuits claim that San Francisco has created a public nuisance, taken private property without just compensation, and violated the equal protection of the law owed to businesses. They are asking for a court injunction to force the city to clean up the streets.Opinion: The Coming Urban ExodusWonder Land: After months of the pandemic, protests and failing progressive leadership, many are going to move out of U.S. centers.

Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—The U.S. warned companies that have suppliers or customers in China of legal and reputational risks linked to human-rights violations there, part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to limit business ties with the country.Companies face peril for involvement with entities blamed for human-rights abuses, including forced labor or the mass detention of Uighur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region, according to a 19-page memo released Wednesday from the Commerce, Treasury, Homeland Security, and State departments.The memo repeatedly cited technology companies whose products can be used for the surveillance of Uighurs.“CEOs should read this notice closely and be aware of the reputation, economic and legal risks of supporting such assaults on human dignity,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on Wednesday.A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington urged the U.S. to “respect facts, drop biases, stop wrongful words and deeds that harm others and themselves and stop meddling in China’s domestic affairs with Xinjiang as a cover.” Beijing says that its efforts in northwest China are meant to counter extremist tendencies among Turkic Muslims.The Trump administration notice doesn’t have legal force and won’t add new rules for businesses. Still, the coordinated warning from four U.S. agencies is a signal that the Trump administration will enforce the laws on the books in ways that could make many companies think twice about doing business in China.“It’s intended to remind businesses that there are sanctions in place, that the situation in Xinjiang is dire, and, most important, that the U.S. government intends to enforce existing law and regulations, meaning more aggressively than they have been in the past,” said Bill Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Besides elevating human-rights concerns on mainland China, the U.S. Congress and the Trump administration are also pressuring Beijing over the new national security law it applied in Hong Kong, furthering an effort to quash dissent and reduce the island’s autonomy. Washington has also waged a trade war with China. A “phase one” trade deal in January serves as a truce but didn’t remove tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of annual U.S. imports from China.President Trump has faced criticism over what is seen as his lack of dedication to addressing human-rights issues abroad, including China’s building of detention camps for more than one million Uighur Muslims without trial, according to estimates by academic researchers. Former national security adviser John Bolton, citing conversations with a U.S. interpreter and one of his deputies, said in his recent book that Mr. Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping that Beijing should go ahead with building the camps. Mr. Trump avoided pressing China over human rights for fear of jeopardizing a trade deal, Mr. Bolton said.The timing of Wednesday’s coordinated government memo on the sanctions is “probably related to reports of what the president told Xi Jinping about the Uighurs and is an effort to offset some of the political damage his alleged comments caused,” Mr. Reinsch said.Mr. Trump disputed Mr. Bolton’s account in an interview with The Wall Street Journal and last month signed the Uighur sanctions bill that passed Congress with broad support.The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, one of several laws mentioned in Wednesday’s memo, directs presidents to apply sanctions to people in China linked to certain actions against Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.Write to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-warns-businesses-over-supply-chains-tied-to-rights-violations-in-china-11593625904
Wall Stree Journal,"The House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday extending the timeline into next month for small businesses to apply for forgivable loans, building on a surprise vote in the Senate a day earlier.The deadline was Tuesday for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was created by Congress in March to provide small businesses with payroll and expense relief during the pandemic. About $130 billion of the original $670 billion set aside has remained unclaimed.Late Tuesday, Senate Democrats attempted to pass a bill by unanimous consent to extend the program. Lawmakers were surprised when that succeeded, a senior Democratic aide said. They had expected a Republican to object, but none did.The bill passed the House with no objections on Wednesday and now heads to the president’s desk for a signature. The White House hasn’t said whether President Trump supports the bill.“It is certainly something to celebrate, but I would’ve hoped that our two parties could have worked this out before last night, as a small part of much broader legislation to address the many challenges posed by Covid-19, rather than a consent request forcing Republicans to act,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.The $670 billion Paycheck Protection Program for businesses with fewer than 500 employees is the largest single element of the government’s $3.5 trillion in spending in response to Covid-19. It has been popular with small businesses, though economists, business owners and bankers say the PPP left behind the most vulnerable companies, many of which were forced to shut down and unable to rehire workers.Lawmakers from both parties are also looking at ways to repurpose the funds should they not all be used.Senate Democrats have proposed legislation that would allow small businesses to take out a second PPP loan if they have 100 or fewer employees. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), chairman of the small-business committee, said this week he wants the next round of the PPP to be targeted at “truly small businesses” and provide financing to underserved communities to ensure minority-owned businesses, particularly Black-owned businesses, have access to capital.Jeff Kasper sorts through boxes at the Legacy Toys store in Bloomington, Minn.’s Mall of America on June 16. Some in Congress want to see new methods for distributing PPP funds that are yet to be claimed.PHOTO: KEREM YUCEL/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGESThe extended deadline sets up a new timeline for Congress to pass its next phase of coronavirus relief and economic stimulus, coming on the heels of the expiration of a $600 extra weekly payment to those receiving unemployment at the end of July. Republicans and Democrats are at odds over whether to continue the program.Democrats in the House passed a roughly $3.5 trillion relief bill last month that was seen as a starting line for negotiations. The massive bill extended the extra unemployment-insurance payments and gave direct payments to Americans, but didn’t give more money to the PPP initiative.Senate Republicans have expressed caution about spending more money and have waited for July to begin working on the next bill. Negotiations are expected to start in earnest when lawmakers return from Independence Day recess.President Trump hasn’t taken a clear stance on extending PPP. He said on Wednesday he supported direct payments, but didn’t support extending extra unemployment insurance benefits.“You would make more money if you don’t go to work,” he said in an interview with Fox Business. “That’s not what the country is all about. And people didn’t want that. They wanted to go to work, but it didn’t make sense, because they make more money if they didn’t.”Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-passes-extension-of-paycheck-protection-program-11593640427

The owners were fined $5,000.Permits were issued in June to install a sidewalk shed around the building to begin construction after the owners were sent the violation.An earlier violation came on March 9, after an inspector found several cracks in the front and side walls of the building, according to city records. Last August, the owners were issued another violation after an inspector observed structural cracks and other issues on an exterior wall.Representatives for Body Elite Gym, which has been closed since March due to the coronavirus, couldn’t be reached for comment.

Wall Stree Journal,"President Trump looks on during an American Workforce Policy Advisory Board Meeting in Washington, June 26.PHOTO: MANDEL NGAN/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGESIt’s Team Trump’s time in the barrel. After the underwhelming crowd in Tulsa, Okla., and polls showing the president trailing Joe Biden substantially, the political commentariat is beginning to say Mr. Trump has no chance of re-election.Hold on.The president is behind with less than 18 weeks to go, and he’s trailing by more than Harry S. Truman in 1948, George W. Bush in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2012, all of whom rallied to win. But 2016 should give every pundit a gigantic dose of humility: Don’t count this president out.The campaign hasn’t really begun. Sequestered in his basement, out of sight for days at a time, Mr. Biden has taken the lead without campaigning as the media’s spotlight has been squarely on the incumbent during a difficult time. But the Democratic nominee can’t hide forever.For Team Trump, the question is what the president must do to regain momentum after a catastrophic June. As president, Mr. Trump has powerful tools, and polls show that on the most important issue in presidential elections, the economy, Americans trust him over Mr. Biden.Though Trump campaign officials say their tracking shows the president’s numbers improving after a drop in early June, the campaign must admit that a reset is needed. Then it needs to do it.This week’s modest staff shake-up isn’t it. A reset is a presidential address on new policy initiatives or a significant change in tone that allows the White House to say credibly that the country is moving in a new direction, repositioning the president. Confronting Senate Democrats over their decision to block consideration of Sen. Tim Scott’s police reform measure presents one such reset opportunity.Finding an issue that grabs public attention is only the start. No president gets re-elected saying only, “I’ve done a good job.” Last week Sean Hannity asked Mr. Trump about his second-term agenda. The president dodged, perhaps not wanting to lay it all out on cable TV. But the moment is fast approaching when Mr. Trump must describe what comes next. Find your calendar and circle Aug. 27, when he will accept his party’s nomination. More Americans will be listening then for what Mr. Trump wants to accomplish in the next four years than at any time in the campaign besides the debates.The last three presidents who won re-election used their acceptance speeches to convince voters they had something new to offer. In 1996, President Clinton pledged to “build a bridge to the 21st century” with an agenda of broader access to education, a balanced budget, an expanded child tax credit, welfare-to-work programs, gun control and support for law enforcement.Mr. Bush’s 2004 convention speech emphasized his economic agenda: tax reform, regulatory relief, energy independence and opportunity zones. He also promised health savings accounts, Social Security reform, increased emphasis on math and science education and an attack on junk medical malpractice lawsuits.In 2012, President Obama offered investments in clean energy and natural gas, 100,000 new math and science teachers, two million new community college students and a tax hike on the wealthy. Mr. Obama also did the other thing that Mr. Trump must do: establish the election as “a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future.”After describing his vision—“the basic bargain at the heart of America’s story, the promise that hard work will pay off, that responsibility will be rewarded, that everyone gets a fair shot”—Mr. Obama went straight after his opponent, Mitt Romney, who he said wanted “tax breaks for millionaires” and supported “firing teachers” and “kicking students off financial aid” before mocking Mr. Romney for calling “Russia our No. 1 enemy.”In this way, Mr. Obama succeeded in making 2012 a choice election. Mr. Trump shouldn’t wait for the convention to start showing voters they face an important choice, as he and Mr. Biden are opposed on big issues. He can start with immigration, energy and trade before moving on to new topics.Mr. Trump’s success will depend on discipline, hardly his strength. Amid multiple crises—a pandemic, a badly damaged economy and racial unrest—Americans need to see competence equal to the country’s challenges, and a bold second-term agenda. Anything that undermines this—a needless tweet, a focus on a less important topic or a feud—increases the odds that Mr. Trump will be a one-term president.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is author of “The Triumph of William McKinley” (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Opinion: MAGA—for AllPotomac Watch: Trump needs to give voters a reason to support him.

Wall Stree Journal,"The band Lady Antebellum, now known as Lady A, arrives at the Country Music Awards in Nashville, Tenn., Nov. 13, 2019.PHOTO: CHARLES PULLIAM/REUTERSWhat do Woodrow Wilson and the Dixie Chicks have in common? This week Princeton University announced it will remove the 28th president’s name from its School of Public and International Affairs, in a rebuke to his “racist thinking and policies.”And last week the country-pop trio dropped the word Dixie from its name, which it’s used since 1989. “We want to meet this moment,” the Chicks said in a one-sentence press release. They later thanked a former New Zealand-based duo “for their gracious gesture in allowing us to share their name.”Like Wilson, the Chicks are progressive to the core. During a March 10, 2003, concert in London, singer Natalie Maines famously announced the band was “ashamed” of President George W. Bush and didn’t support war in Iraq. That prompted a backlash from fans and radio stations and an apology from Ms. Maines, which she took back in 2006: “I apologized for disrespecting the office of the president, but I don’t feel that way anymore. I don’t feel he is owed any respect whatsoever.” The band has since backed causes from Planned Parenthood to MoveOn.org.The Chicks weren’t the first country band to undergo such a name change in June. Two weeks earlier, Lady Antebellum shortened its name to Lady A. The group had said its old name was an architectural reference, inspired by a photo shoot at an antebellum mansion. As early as 2011 a critic wrote that it glorified “a culture that was based on the violent oppression of people of color.”A statement from the band explaining the name change asserted that members had consulted with their “closest black friends and colleagues” during the George Floyd protests, and “blind spots we didn’t even know existed have been revealed.” A few days later, the band apologized to Anita White, a black singer who was already using the stage name Lady A.The oddest case is that of David Lee Roth, best known as Van Halen’s on-again-off-again lead singer. On June 22 Mr. Roth tweeted a cartoon that declared: “Diamond Dave following Lady Antebellum’s . . . example, will be dropping the ‘Lee.’ From now on he wants us all to call him ‘David L. Roth’ or simply ‘El Roth.’ ”David Lee is Mr. Roth’s given name. It seems implausible that his parents—a Jewish couple in Bloomington, Ind.—had any special affinity for Gen. Robert E. Lee. Is Mr. Roth joking? I put the question to his agent, Gerri Leonard, who replied by email that she and Mr. Roth are “unavailable for comment.”Mr. Taube, a columnist for Troy Media and Loonie Politics, was a speechwriter for former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Opinion: Smiley Face LiberalismWonder Land: The collapse of liberal elites under a leftist offensive has been in the making since the 'Summer of Love.'

Wall Stree Journal,"Opinion: You Say You Want a Revolution?Wonder Land: The benchmark for American revolt remains the Declaration of Independence signed on July 4, 1776. Images: Keystone/Getty Images/Reuters Composite: Mark KellyThey can take down Teddy Roosevelt, and Princeton can cancel Woodrow Wilson. They can topple Ulysses Grant, deface the Lincoln Memorial, throw ropes around Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square, knock down the author of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” put Thomas Jefferson in storage, and say America’s founding began in 1619. But they can’t make the Fourth of July disappear.Rewriting history doesn’t yet include eliminating daily turns of the calendar, so they will have to endure the hard fact that between July 3 and July 5 falls the Fourth of July and that most Americans still believe this day is about the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.This is the most notable July 4 in a long time, because the United States, all of a sudden, is in a revolutionary moment.Until now, the Fourth of July was the holiday celebrated by everyone in the U.S. as an American tradition. The message being sent by the protesters in the streets is, “Your traditions don’t mean a thing to us, and we will toss them out as we see fit.”Each year, nearly every town holds a Fourth of July parade and celebrates with evening fireworks. This year, the coronavirus pandemic means few parades, while in New York City and elsewhere, massive nightly fireworks are intended to intimidate, not celebrate.The Fourth of July is, or was, a day of families joined in quiet expressions of patriotism, with American flags flying. This year, families are divided, the air filled with shouted bitterness and somewhere this weekend an American flag will be burned.The U.S. is in a revolutionary moment not just because of the street protests after the death of George Floyd or because of the pulling down of presidents’ monuments. On their own, these demonstrations wouldn’t come to much, primarily because—if the on-camera interviews conducted with protesters are representative—the substance of their protest is so unformed and diffused. Fireworks—loud, startling and self-extinguishing—are an apt metaphor.The important element is the acts of consent from America’s elites. These people sit atop the country’s commanding institutions—in academia, business, politics, bureaucracies, media, book publishing, museums, philanthropies—and their instant assent provides legitimacy and puts us into something resembling a revolutionary situation. Which means this will be a revolutionary presidential election, the second in a row.In that spirit, let me recommend some weekend reading: the Declaration of Independence. See how you react to revisiting the ideas that made a real revolution, stated in less than 1,500 words.Even amid that upheaval there was wit. Without once naming George III, they refer merely to “the present King of Great Britain.” Today you would search in vain for a member of the “resistance” who consigns Mr. Trump to anonymity as “the current president of the United States.” That no such sophisticated insult is possible reflects how far we’ve come, or gone.Among the most striking differences between revolutionaries then and now is that the signers included in their Declaration a bill of particulars for their intention to separate. Once past Jefferson’s famous phrases about all men created equal and unalienable rights, he states, “let facts be submitted” and lays them out in 27 staccato paragraphs.One is struck by the tone of optimistic defiance in the Declaration’s text. Compare it with the pro forma, almost cookie-cutter language in statements from the boards of directors at Princeton or the American Museum of Natural History, who instead sound like defeated men and women. Wherever the current revolt may end, it’s hard to see our own confused, wan elites as the heirs to the country’s original leadership.A forewarning to Trumpians: These first declarers also take “the Tyrant” to task on immigrants, for “refusing to pass” laws “to encourage their migrations hither.” And international commerce, “for cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world.” All sides today will claim to find supporting language in the Declaration’s text, such as, “They too have been deaf to the voice of justice.”Times change—and that’s the point. Through the Revolution, the Civil War and all the years since that signing, the American idea has been about social, political and economic progress.In contrast, the defining symbol that now attaches to the current revolution—and their conscious choice—is the removing of monuments, including the general who won the War for Independence and the general who won the Civil War over slavery.It is a misstatement to call what is going on now an American revolution. The Declaration’s revolution was about creating a new nation. Today’s claimants see the future as de novo, a blank slate, an exercise in elimination. It is closer to what the ever-ironic 1960s radical anarchist Abbie Hoffman called “revolution for the hell of it.” That isn’t enough.This weekend’s Fourth of July is the 244th anniversary of American’s first revolution. It remains the benchmark against which any successor idea must be measured.Write henninger@wsj.com.",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-say-you-want-a-revolution-11593642468

Wall Stree Journal,"Richard Haass is a prolific author on international affairs, served as a foreign-policy official in the Reagan and both Bush administrations, and is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations. He is, in short, a high-ranking member of American foreign policy’s clerisy. As if to emphasize the point, he relates that the inspiration for his book “The World: A Brief Introduction” began with a day of fishing in Nantucket, where he spoke with a student from Stanford who confessed that he had taken few courses in economics, politics or history. Otherwise educated young people today, Mr. Haass concludes, “are essentially uninformed about the world they are entering.” He hopes to change this state of affairs with “The World.”What Mr. Haass has written, alas, is a series of dry primers about the world’s regions and their problems. The book is rife with soporific statements with which it would be difficult to disagree: “Economic problems within Europe have been ever more significant. As a result, the Continent has had low rates of growth.” The assumption seems to be that the young have disengaged from the world because they lack access to information. But engagement has fallen even as the internet has made access to information effortless.Mr. Haass is among the most respected foreign-policy experts in the world and is fully capable of proposing bold ideas that would put American strategy on a more sustainable path. That “The World” offers mostly uncontroversial data points rather than fresh analysis helps to explain why two (and in some respects three) consecutive U.S. administrations have often rejected the dominant views of foreign-policy experts.The useful parts of the book mostly come in the opening section, which briskly relays the “essential history” of international affairs. The Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 established the nation-state as the basic political unit in Europe. Webs of alliances and the rise of nationalism set the stage for World War I—and trade ties were not enough to prevent it. This context is important because contemporary debates about international relations often proceed as if history started with World War II.  After this crash course, the reader expects a survey of the contemporary world with some sort of vision to bind it together. Instead the primers on different regions often resemble U.N. bureaucracy memos. We learn, for example, that “for most African countries, their biggest challenge has been establishing good governance” and that Latin American countries need to “promote civil society and thereby make their democracies more robust.” If Mr. Haass’s “narrative flair . . . sparkle[s] on every page,” as Doris Kearns Goodwin writes in a blurb for the book, I did not notice.PHOTO: WSJTHE WORLDBy Richard HaassPenguin Press, 400 pages, $28Mr. Haass seems determined to avoid staking out a definitive position on key issues. Consider the section on East Asia and the Pacific. China is America’s chief great-power rival, and competition has intensified sharply in recent years. Mr. Haass notes that “Asia is where this era’s major powers come into regular, direct contact with one another.” He describes the U.S.-China relationship as entering its “fourth phase”: early Cold War hostility; the thaw under Nixon; economic partnership after 1991; and now renewed rivalry. What will this rivalry look like and how should Americans approach it? One view holds that the U.S. should cede to China a sphere of influence in the Western Pacific lest it be drawn into a repeat of its 1940s war with Japan. Another holds that the U.S. should treat China the way it did the Soviet Union and try to contain its geopolitical reach.Mr. Haass’s conclusion? “The direction of the U.S.-China relationship will be critical for the region’s future.” Stability in Asia is “possible, but it is by no means assured.” Ah.Then again, perhaps the 21st century won’t be shaped primarily by competition between its most powerful countries. Mr. Haass considers that the next era in world politics may be defined instead by global-governance issues like climate change, trade, economic development and the internet. A world defined by multilateral problem-solving has been the dream of foreign-policy experts for decades.That hasn’t come to pass in part because mandarins and policy makers tend to cast “global” issues as questions of expert technocratic management rather than political choice. Mr. Haass writes of climate change, for example, that “the notion that responsible policy and economic growth are at odds is not backed by the evidence.” But the types of measures needed to meaningfully limit climate change, good or bad, would almost certainly impinge on economic growth, and voters know it.Other pronouncements on global problems are similarly platitudinous. On trade: “The problem ahead is that the barriers to further progress are complex and addressing them will prove more difficult.” On global poverty: “Progress will require concerted effort on the part of governments, international agencies, foundations, businesses, and NGOs.” Diplomats and foreign-policy mavens often have to obfuscate and say as little as possible, but this isn’t the place to practice that dull art.If Mr. Haass has a theme, it’s that the global system is increasingly fragile. He is right—and he was writing before China used the cover of a pandemic to further colonize the South China Sea and embark on lethal military provocations along the Indian border. Mr. Haass writes that “order is not the natural state of international affairs and does not just emerge or continue automatically.”True, but I suspect the young elites Mr. Haass hopes to reach with this book won’t have much interest in sustaining a world order that sounds like an abstraction—a set of anodyne talking points and uninspiring good-governance projects. As chaotic and unprincipled as President Trump’s foreign policy has been, it has the benefit of cutting through certain types of empty jargon and unquestioned assumptions.

Wall Stree Journal,"Richmond’s mayor on Wednesday used emergency powers to order the immediate removal of about a dozen Confederate statues, citing public safety concerns and a need for healing in a city still grappling with its legacy as the capital of the Confederacy during the Civil War.A crane hoisted an equestrian statue of Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson from the pedestal where it had stood since 1919 and onto a flatbed truck. The mayor said crews would haul away the rest of the statues, some of which line Monument Avenue, in coming days.“It is past time,” Mayor Levar Stoney, a Democrat, said. “We have needed to turn this page for decades, and today we will.”Mr. Stoney said he was also acting to protect the public. For more than a month, he noted, the city has been the site of daily protests sparked by the May 25 killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Protests have often centered around Confederate statues, and police at times have used tear gas to disperse demonstrators.Protesters on June 10 pulled down a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis from its perch on boulevard-like Monument Avenue. They have covered others with graffiti, including a six-story monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that was erected in 1890 and is topped by a bronze statue of him on horseback.“As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to surge, and protesters attempt to take down Confederate statues themselves, or confront others who are doing so, the risk grows for serious illness, injury or death,” Mr. Stoney said.The mayor’s order doesn’t apply to the state-owned Lee statue. Early last month Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, said crews would take it down, but a judge issued a temporary injunction blocking its removal.Earlier this year the Democratic-led state legislature passed a bill, signed by Mr. Northam, that allows cities to decide for themselves what to do with such statues starting July 1.Confederate statues have fallen cross the U.S. since the large-scale protests spurred by Mr. Floyd’s killing. Protesters have toppled some, and officials have decided to remove others.Mr. Stoney said he would work with the city council to outline a public process for what to do with the statues. Meanwhile, they will be kept in storage, he said.Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/richmond-va-mayor-orders-removal-of-confederate-statues-11593635460
Wall Stree Journal,"Capital Group Cos., Barings LLC and One William Street Capital Management LP are among the asset-backed securities lenders fighting Hertz Global Holdings Inc.’s plan to reduce its U.S. rental fleet by more than a fourth.That trio plus three other investment firms were identified Tuesday in a bankruptcy-court filing as the members of a committee that own asset-backed securities in the form of Hertz medium-term notes. Other group members are Aegon Group NV, Fort Washington Investment Advisors Inc. and American International Group Inc.The car-rental company, which filed for chapter 11 reorganization in May, last month asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., for permission to reject the leases for about 144,000 vehicles, a move it says would save it roughly $80 million a month.MORE FROM WSJ PRO BANKRUPTCYSycamore Bids $540 Million for Ann Taylor, Other Ascena Brands November 26, 2020U.S. Found Not Responsible for Puerto Rico Bond Losses November 23, 2020Offshore Oil-Rig Operator Noble Cleared to Exit Chapter 11 November 23, 2020But the group of asset-backed lenders, along with Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co., say their master lease deal with Hertz means that the company, despite its bankruptcy, can’t treat its vehicle fleet as if there are multiple leases.Hertz has financed its U.S. rental fleet under an asset-backed securitization structure allowing it to raise tens of billions of dollars at much lower rates than if it had issued its own debt, the group said last month. That’s because ABS debt typically receives a higher credit rating than the operating company could achieve on its own, resulting in lower funding costs.A court filing Tuesday identified the medium-term noteholder committee members and disclosed their stakes affected by the bankruptcy.Collectively, the members own or manage, or are investment advisers for funds that own or manage, more than $1.1 billion of the principal of Hertz medium-term notes.Some in the group also own other Hertz bonds or credit-default swaps.Los Angeles-based Capital Group, which manages more than $1.7 trillion in stock and fixed-income assets, owns $333 million of the bonds, the filing said.New York-based One William Street Capital, which has more than $4.5 billion in assets, mostly in ABS and structured credit, owns about $190 million.Barings LLC, a $327 billion-asset subsidiary of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., owns $213 million of the bonds.Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/aig-and-barings-among-lenders-objecting-to-hertz-fleet-cuts-11593641866
Wall Stree Journal,"The U.S. issued new guidance on how authorities assess whether mergers within a supply chain might affect competition—an update that could have implications for federal antitrust enforcers’ focus on the technology sector.The guidance on so-called vertical mergers, released Tuesday, is the first since 1984 on how such mergers will be approached by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, which coordinate enforcement of the nation’s federal antitrust laws.The guidance lays out the economic concepts and analytical techniques that the two agencies will use in deciding whether vertical mergers decrease competition and harm consumers.CONTENT FROM OUR SPONSORDeloitteRisk management, strategy and analysis from DeloitteFuture of Controllership: Data-Driven Strategy PartnerThe pandemic may be reshaping the face of the corporate controllership, accelerating a transition to more technology, data-driven insights, and remote capabilities. Leaders at organizations such as Converse and UGI are reconsidering many aspects of work, workforce, and workplace to achieve a more flexible, proactive finance function.Please note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.More from DeloitteChallenges to vertical mergers are rare. Economists in recent decades have generally viewed mergers between upstream and downstream companies—such as a car maker buying a parts supplier—as less problematic than horizontal ones between businesses that compete directly in the same market.NEWSLETTER SIGN-UPRisk and Compliance JournalOur Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance.PREVIEWSUBSCRIBEBut as consolidation across industries has increased, officials have come under pressure to take a harder look at the consequences of such combinations.“The guidelines have needed to be updated for a long time and the new version really does bring them into the 21st century,” said Renata Hesse, a co-head of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP’s antitrust group who previously led the Justice Department’s antitrust division.The Justice Department’s challenge to AT&T Inc.’s acquisition of Time Warner Inc. in 2017—which was the first fully litigated challenge to a vertical merger in 40 years—has also placed more attention on vertical mergers. The case ended in a historic defeat for the government, which had argued that AT&T would have the ability to use Time Warner’s Turner networks as a weapon against competitors of its DirecTV satellite television service.The guidelines on vertical mergers could have special implications for acquisitions within the tech industry, which has come under particular scrutiny by lawmakers and federal antitrust enforcers.The Justice Department and the FTC have skirmished over investigations into the potentially anti-competitive business practices of the tech sector, with the agencies agreeing to divvy up any probes of the nation’s largest tech companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.One possible competitive harm outlined by the agencies in the new guidelines is access a vertical merger could give to competitively sensitive information. A supplier that merges with a company upstream could have data about a competitor to that company, the agencies said.“In the tech space it’s going to be interesting to see how that plays out,” said Jeffrey Martino, a partner at law firm Baker & Hostetler LLP who until last year served as chief of the Justice Department’s antitrust division office in New York. “You have all these companies with so much data. How are the agencies going to deal with that?”The guidance also discusses how a vertical merger could diminish competition by allowing the newly integrated company to raise its rivals’ costs or even block the supply of a crucial part or product altogether—a practice known as foreclosure.An earlier draft of the guidance was circulated for public comment in January. The draft contained a safe-harbor provision stating that the agencies were unlikely to challenge a vertical merger where the parties have a combined share of less than 20%.The provision received pushback from some antitrust experts and groups that submitted comments about the draft, and it was dropped from the final version.In addition to suggesting areas where enforcers might look for competitive harm, the guidelines also outline ways in which vertical mergers could create efficiencies that ultimately benefit consumers in the form of lower prices.The hope of advocates for a more business-friendly approach was that the guidance would basically make all vertical transactions presumptively lawful, said Ms. Hesse of Sullivan & Cromwell. The hope of those in favor of more antitrust enforcement was that the memo wouldn’t discuss the potential efficiency of vertical mergers.Ultimately, the guidance signals a measured approach to vertical mergers, she said.Write to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/antitrust-enforcers-update-approach-to-vertical-mergers-11593640781
Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—President Trump threatened to veto an annual must-pass bill if senators don’t remove language that would require the Defense Department to rename U.S. military bases that honor the Confederacy, but his demand drew a chilly reception from Republican lawmakers.The language was added to the bill last month in the form of a bipartisan amendment, proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), to the National Defense Authorization Act. It passed out of a GOP-led committee in mid-June by voice vote, with only a handful of Republicans opposing it.In a tweet posted shortly before midnight, Mr. Trump used a derogatory nickname he has long applied to Ms. Warren and cited forts named for Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Braxton Bragg.“I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!” Mr. Trump tweeted.BATTLES OVER CONFEDERATE SYMBOLSRacial-justice protests have directed fresh attention to monuments and symbols that honor the Confederacy, renewing efforts to retire many of them.Richmond, Va., Mayor Orders Removal of Confederate StatuesMississippi Legislature Passes Bill to Change State FlagConfederate Names Are Common in the U.S.—and Not Just on StatuesAfter Years of Debate, Confederate Symbols Disappear QuicklyThe president has previously voiced opposition to renaming bases that honor the Confederacy, the group of 11 rebellious Southern states that fought an insurrection against the U.S. in the 1860s to preserve slavery and white supremacy. That put Mr. Trump at odds with top Pentagon officials. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said in June that they were open to renaming the bases and after several prominent retired Army generals called for the change.Ms. Warren defended her provision in a speech on the Senate floor earlier this week.“Those who complain that removing the names of traitors from these bases ignores history ought to learn some history themselves,” she said, calling the base names part of a “movement that tried to glorify the Confederacy and reinforce white supremacy.”Fort Lee, in Virginia, and Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, were established in the 1910s, during the Jim Crow period in which laws enshrined racial segregation and efforts across the country sought to memorialize the Confederacy in public symbols and institutions.Mr. Trump’s late-night pledge to veto the $740 billion defense bill comes as part of a push to remove symbols of the Confederacy, newly energized by mass demonstrations against racism and police abuses across the country. Earlier this week, lawmakers in Mississippi voted by a wide margin to change the state flag, which contains the Confederate battle emblem.At this stage, it will be difficult for Republicans to strip out Ms. Warren’s provision mandating the renaming of the bases. It would likely require at least 60 votes in the Senate, where Republican only hold 53 seats.The House and Senate are working to pass separate versions of the defense bill in coming weeks. After that, both chambers are expected to enter talks to reconcile their versions before presenting a final product to the president to sign into law, a process expected to take months.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a Trump ally, said he would recommend against the president vetoing the defense bill. He is one of several prominent Republican lawmakers who have indicated they support renaming bases.“The issue of Army bases being named after Confederate generals is a legitimate concern in the times in which we live,” Mr. Graham said. “I’m OK with a process that the Senate came up with. And there’s a lot of good things in this bill, and I don’t think this is a reason big enough to veto the bill.”Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he is confident Mr. Trump won’t ultimately veto the bill. “It’ll probably be November by the time it’d be coming to his desk anyway, so a lot can happen in between now and then,” Mr. Inhofe said. “Hopefully he won’t have a reason to veto it.” He added that he feels just as strongly as Mr. Trump about keeping the Confederate base names.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) didn’t answer directly when asked about Mr. Trump’s veto threat, saying only that he was “trying to set up the votes, trying to finish the bill.”Related VideoProtesters Attempt to Topple Andrew Jackson Statue in D.C.Clashes broke out as protesters tried to pull down a statue of 19th century President Andrew Jackson, a target of demonstrators because of his treatment of Native Americans. The statue is located in Lafayette Square, near the White House. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images (Originally published June 23, 2020)Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) predicted Wednesday that Mr. Trump wouldn’t carry through on his threat to tank a bill that contains pay raises for troops and crucial support for the military.“This is typical bluster from President Trump,” Mr. Schumer said. “The NDAA will pass, and we will scrub from our military bases the names of men who fought for the Confederacy and took up arms against our country.”Several GOP senators have introduced amendments to replace Ms. Warren’s measure as it now stands in the Senate version of the bill, but so far no amendment votes have been scheduled on the floor. Any such votes could put vulnerable Republicans on the spot as they fight for re-election in crucial battleground states.One amendment offered by Sens. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) would task a commission to study bases and other military assets named for people associated with the Confederacy before submitting a list to Congress and the Department of Defense, which would decide whether to proceed with any renamings.Another amendment offered by Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) wouldn’t require the bases to be renamed, as Ms. Warren’s language does. It would create a commission to hold public hearings and gather input from military families and veterans, as well as state and local communities.Mr. Hawley said in a floor speech last month that he offered the amendment to “undo this effort at historical revisionism.”But Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D., Mo.), who was the first Black mayor of Kansas City, Mo., disagreed.“That is not rewriting history, it’s righting history,” Mr. Cleaver said in a recent interview.Mr. Cleaver said he tries to give the benefit of the doubt to his Republican colleagues, but he thinks they need to understand the pain Confederate-linked bases and statues cause to descendants of slaves, including himself.“That war was fought in no small part over whether or not Frank Harrison Cleaver would become a free man or not. That’s my great-great-grandpa,” he said. “It was about whether or not he was human or chattel.”Write to Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com and Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-threatens-to-veto-defense-bill-over-provision-to-strip-confederate-base-names-11593614483
Wall Stree Journal,"So far, it has been a summer of disappointment and frustration at Coney Island, the historic Brooklyn beachside amusement area that is largely shut because of the coronavirus pandemic.But with New York City opening beaches for swimming on Wednesday, some longtime Coney businesses, such as food vendors, hoped for a little good news in terms of more foot traffic in the area.Then, the midday storm clouds arrived.“Of course it’s going to rain,” said Dennis Vourderis, co-owner of Deno’s Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, which has several rides at Coney Island, including the namesake wheel.Coney Island remains a symbol of the New York seaside.Not that Mr. Vourderis could reap much business from those coming to frolic in the surf, save for his food concession. But it was a day filled with expectation, a beacon that a true Coney Island summer could still be a reality, especially with the hope that rides and attractions will be allowed to reopen later in the summer with a blessing from the state and the city.At least in the early part of the day, the beach had its share of visitors, including those who took a dip in the ocean. Most welcomed the opportunity, even if they remarked that Coney Island without the sounds of the Cyclone roller coaster and other scream-inducing attractions isn’t quite the same experience.“Coney Island is the beach and the rides,” said Maricel Elias, a 43-year-old Brooklyn resident who came Wednesday with her three children.Bob Spataro, a 59-year-old Staten Island resident who said he comes to Coney “every chance I get,” concurred that it was a little too quiet for his taste.Left, a social distancing sign at the Coney Island boardwalk. Right, people exercised on the beach at Coney Island on Wednesday.“It’s almost surreal,” he said as he worked on his tan before considering a swim.Swimmers had options beyond Coney Island, from Orchard Beach in the Bronx to Rockaway Beach in Queens. The city also said Wednesday that it would be reopening some of its public pools by Aug. 1.Nevertheless, Coney Island remains a symbol of the New York seaside. It is also one that has seen its fortunes improve in recent years, after decades of decline, in large part because of a city redevelopment plan and $400 million in public and private investment.The area has welcomed MCU Park, a minor-league baseball stadium that is home to the Brooklyn Cyclones, and the Ford Amphitheater, an entertainment venue that hosts concerts and festivals. As with the rides, both those venues aren’t currently operating—in fact, the Cyclones season has been canceled as part of the 2020 shutdown of minor-league baseball.Luna Park, another major amusement operator in Coney Island, had plans to expand its list of attractions this summer, with the opening of a roller coaster and a flume ride. Naturally, it had to jettison those projects for now, along with some other new attractions, such as a beer garden.Many hope that the Cyclone roller coaster and other scream-inducing attractions will be allowed to reopen later in the summer.“This year was supposed to be an amazing year,” said Alessandro Zamperla, president of Central Amusement International Inc., owner of Luna Park. Mr. Zamperla said the projects in the works represent a $20 million investment on his company’s part, though he hopes they can be opened for the 2021 season.Meanwhile, Mr. Zamperla is waiting to see if the state and city’s reopening process will eventually allow for the rides to start up again. His company also operates the Cyclone.Some Coney Island businesses are finding a way this summer. Crowds are still coming to Nathan’s Famous, the food vendor with two Coney locations that is known for its Fourth of July hot dog-eating contest. This year’s event is still happening, but will be closed to the public.James Walker, senior vice president of Nathan’s Famous, said that some days this season have been just about as busy as in summers past.

Wall Stree Journal,"Federal Reserve officials last month reviewed how to design more support for an economy reeling from the coronavirus pandemic while expressing concerns over the risks of additional virus outbreaks.The central bank on Wednesday released minutes of its June 9-10 meeting, at which officials signaled they expected to keep rates near zero at least through 2022. They cut rates to near zero in March and have sharply expanded their asset portfolio to stabilize government debt and other lending markets.Officials are in no hurry to remove that support. The minutes showed they made progress last month toward consensus on a strategy to guide borrowing costs lower by spelling out in greater detail how long they plan to hold rates down. By contrast, the minutes showed officials were nowhere close to agreement on a potentially complementary tool to reinforce that guidance by committing to cap Treasury yields with unlimited purchases of short- or medium-term government securities.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell opened the meeting by acknowledging national protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. He cited the “extraordinary and deeply troubling events” of the preceding two weeks, in which “injustice, prejudice and the callous disregard for life had led to social unrest and a sense of despair,” the minutes said.Mr. Powell told his colleagues he planned to open his news conference following their meeting with a message to reaffirm the central bank’s “unflinching commitment” to rejecting racism and promoting full participation of all members of society in the economy.Separately, Fed officials worried at the meeting that prematurely resuming certain commercial activities without proper public-health safeguards or voluntary social distancing could hurt the economy in the months ahead by widening the spread of the virus.Officials saw “a great deal of uncertainty” about whether a safe reopening could be achieved, the minutes said. They “expressed concerns about the possibility that an early reopening would contribute to a significant increase of infections.”Related VideoWhat PMI Numbers Won’t Tell YouIn recent years, purchasing-managers indexes have become important indicators of where the global economy might be heading. But in the current slowdown, where small businesses were some of the hardest hit, PMI numbers might not be telling the full story. WSJ explains. Photo: Getty ImagesEither way, officials believed “highly accommodative monetary policy and sustained support from fiscal policy” would be needed to ensure a durable recovery in jobs.While employers reported a surprising 2.5 million increase in employment in May, Fed officials didn’t seem particularly enthused about pickups in hiring or spending because around 20 million fewer people were employed compared with February and because of difficulty determining the extent to which temporary federal relief measures, such as enhanced unemployment benefits, had supported incomes.Officials continued deliberations over the best way to provide more stimulus for the economy now that interest rates have been cut to near zero. The minutes indicated those discussions were likely to continue without any firm resolution at their next meeting, scheduled for July 28-29, setting up a possible resolution and announcement at their following gathering in September.Officials reviewed how to make more explicit their so-called forward guidance for the path of the benchmark federal-funds rate and their bond purchases. The minutes showed support was broadest for a strategy to condition the removal of stimulus on the economy meeting certain thresholds, particularly related to inflation outcomes.Several officials supported a strategy in which the Fed temporarily would allow inflation to run modestly above its 2% target to make up for a prior inflation shortfall once the economy recovers from the pandemic. Officials thought this approach would potentially prevent a “premature withdrawal” of Fed stimulus, the minutes said.Such a strategy would be a significant departure from the practice the Fed has used over the past 30 years to pre-emptively raise interest rates to head off inflationary pressures.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat do you make of the Fed’s meeting minutes? Join the conversation below.Fed economists briefed policy makers last month on different strategies to cap yields on Treasury securities by committing to purchase whatever amounts are needed to keep yields at certain levels. The tool has some appeal because it could reinforce officials’ intentions to keep rates low and, if investors believe those commitments are credible, it could provide the same amount of stimulus without requiring as many Fed bond purchases.Still, the minutes indicated officials were in the early stages of reviewing such plans, with many voicing skepticism. “Nearly all participants indicated that they had many questions regarding the costs and benefits of such an approach,” the minutes said.Several officials thought that as long as the Fed’s guidance to keep rates low for a long time was credible, the costs of yield caps might not be worth the presumed benefits.Some saw the tool as less compatible with the threshold-based guidance officials preferred. Others worried such policies could lead the Fed to lose control of its balance sheet or surrender its autonomy to manage policy to fiscal authorities at the Treasury.Economic research presented at the meeting suggested that, with rates at zero, the use of forward guidance and asset purchases could require the Fed to provide stimulus for “many years to quicken meaningfully the recovery from the current severe downturn.”The staff briefing warned that those policies wouldn’t be as effective if they weren’t well understood by the public. “Alternatively, prompt and forceful policy actions by the committee might help focus the public’s expectations around better outcomes or reduce perceived risks of worst-case scenarios,” the minutes said.MORE ON THE ECONOMYFlorida’s Approval of $15 Minimum Wage Sets Up Battle in Other States November 27, 2020U.S. Unemployment Claims Rose to 778,000 Last Week November 25, 2020U.S. Consumer Spending Grows for Sixth Straight Month November 25, 2020Fed Signals New Guidance Coming on Asset-Purchase Program November 25, 2020The Fed cuts rates when economic growth is poor to encourage businesses and households to invest or spend. In the years after the 2008 financial crisis, with short-term rates pinned near zero, the Fed’s other tools worked primarily by driving down long-term rates, which made it easier for households to pay off debts and encouraged new borrowing and risk taking.Several Fed officials last month voiced concern that those bond-buying tools might be less powerful now because long-term interest rates have declined around the world, leaving less room to influence investor behavior by pushing bond yields lower.These officials still thought bond buying could support the economy, however, by offsetting potential increases in long-term interest rates or by reinforcing the Fed’s forward guidance.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-debated-options-to-provide-more-economic-support-11593626400
Wall Stree Journal,"McDonald’s Corp. MCD -0.46% is pausing the reopening of dine-in service in the U.S. as coronavirus cases continue to spread across states.The burger giant said Wednesday that it would wait three weeks before any new U.S. restaurants add dine-in service to its drive-through, takeout and delivery operations.“Our resiliency will be tested again. Covid-19 cases are on the rise,” said a company letter by Joe Erlinger, McDonald’s U.S. president, and Mark Salebra, head of the National Franchisee Leadership Alliance owners association, that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.McDonald’s operators began offering limited, dine-in service in May, and around 2,200 of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants now allow customers to eat their meals inside. Restaurant owners that began offering dine-in service can continue if their jurisdiction still allows it, the letter said, but the company decided to halt additional openings as a number of state and local governments tighten social-distancing regulations ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend.More states, cities and counties are scaling back on reopening plans for bars and restaurants given a surge in virus cases. On Wednesday, California ordered 19 counties to stop allowing indoor dining and recreation for at least three weeks as cases have rapidly grown in the most populous areas. New York City, meanwhile, delayed indoor dining service that was slated to resume July 6.Various nonfood businesses are reassessing plans. For instance, Apple Inc. said it is temporarily closing 16 locations in Florida, Mississippi, Texas and Utah as of Wednesday, a spokesman said in an email. Ten of those closures were in Texas, which has seen a surge in Covid-19 cases recently. The reversals come as a blow for sit-down restaurants hoping to begin serving more customers this summer.

Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—The House passed a broad, $1.5 trillion effort to rebuild the nation’s roads, railways and schools, as Democrats pursued their own infrastructure legislation without the bipartisan deal discussed for years during the Trump administration.Almost 40 House Democrats joined with House Republicans to approve a last-minute amendment to the legislation on the floor. The change aims to bar the government from using funds in the bill to enter into contracts with Chinese state-owned companies or Chinese companies that construct facilities for interning Uighurs in western China.The bill pours more than $300 billion into repairing bridges and roads, $130 billion into schools that educate low-income children, more than $100 billion into building or preserving affordable housing and $100 billion into expanding broadband internet access. Republicans oppose the legislation, which also includes a host of measures aimed at fighting climate change, and the White House has said President Trump would veto it if it came to his desk.Mr. Trump has called for Congress to pass a major infrastructure package since he won the White House in 2016, but the extensive bipartisan negotiations necessary to pass such a bill have repeatedly faltered.The president has recently sought $2 trillion in infrastructure spending to help the economy recover from the recession induced by the coronavirus pandemic. Senate Republicans, averse to such a major spending effort, haven’t embraced the administration’s push, and Democrats said they had lost patience hoping for a bipartisan deal that could become law to materialize.“We have been on the cusp of producing a trillion-dollar bill, now it’s a $2 trillion bill, where is it? Where is it, where’s their alternative?” said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.), the chairman of the House Infrastructure and Transportation Committee.In a statement advising the president to veto the bill, the Trump administration criticized the bill for not finding money to pay for the new investments and not including measures accelerating the permitting process for new infrastructure projects.The House Democratic bill puts roughly $100 billion into new transit funding, investing in putting more buses that don’t release carbon emissions on the road. It would also provide roughly $65 billion in funding for water infrastructure and $29 billion to Amtrak over five years.While the House Democratic bill is unlikely to become law in the near future, lawmakers face a Sept. 30 deadline to act before the current five-year highway bill expires. Both the House bill and a separate highway bill in the Senate would provide for five more years of spending on highways and safety programs.The House bill would spend $411 billion from the Highway Trust Fund, which is fed by taxes on fuel purchases and has faced shortfalls in recent years, while the Senate bill authorizes $287 billion over five years. The Senate bill passed unanimously out of committee last year, but, like the House bill, it lacks a plan for providing new revenue.The federal government hasn’t raised the tax on gasoline and diesel since 1993, and revenue to the Highway Trust Fund has dropped as vehicles have become more fuel-efficient. Republicans have opposed raising the gas tax.Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said funding transportation projects with money from the gas tax has become more challenging as the pandemic has cut back on travel and fuel purchases. He said reauthorizing highway funding could occur in the next economic relief bill.“If there is another recovery bill, it would be important to include in that bill the things that we were able to do in a bipartisan way in the Senate rather than what they did in a partisan way in the House,” he said.Congress has approved roughly $3 trillion in relief funding over the course of four bills this spring, and House Democrats passed a $3.5 trillion relief bill in May. Senate Republicans haven’t yet committed to approving another relief bill, which they say will consider in earnest beginning in mid-July.Write to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-passes-1-5-trillion-infrastructure-bill-11593638962

Cheri Bustos, chair of the House Democrats’ campaign arm, said in a statement.Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, on Wednesday expressed concern that the QAnon movement was gaining traction.“I’m worried about people falling for unsubstantiated, uncorroborated conspiracy theories that frankly have no basis in fact that we know of,” he told reporters. “It’s a big party with a lot of people who have different points of views but I’m convinced that Republican principle will remain steady even though we’ve taken a departure from time to time.”Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-politics-fueled-challenger-in-colorado-house-gop-primary-11593638290
Wall Stree Journal,"John Paulson made billions of dollars anticipating the 2008 financial collapse. But after running into difficulties in recent years, Mr. Paulson will convert his hedge fund firm into a private investment firm that runs only his family’s money.Mr. Paulson’s decision to hand his investors’ their cash back and turn his firm into a family office has been long telegraphed as assets at his firm have fallen and returns declined. He had a strong year last year, in which his key merger hedge fund rose nearly 30%. But the fund is down over 10% so far this year, according to someone close to the matter.Investors have been leaving his funds for nearly a decade. Paulson & Co. managed less than $9 billion last year, most of which is his own money, down from $38 billion in 2011.Mr. Paulson is the latest investing star to make the move.Over the past few years, well-known investors including Leon Cooperman, Eric Mindich and Jonathon Jacobson have returned billions in client money and converted their own firms into family offices, amid a period in which the hedge fund industry has failed to keep up with broader stock and bond markets. Unusual volatility, efforts by the Federal Reserve to bolster markets, and a rush of news and other data that can be hard to digest, have all been factors making it harder for traditional investors to keep up.Mr. Paulson’s decision was first reported by Bloomberg News. The 64-year-old investor wouldn’t comment.“The last 26 years of running an asset management firm have been thoroughly rewarding,” Mr. Paulson said in a client letter. “Recent volatility notwithstanding, I am proud of our long-term returns.”Mr. Paulson achieved investing fame in an unlikely fashion.Born in Queens, New York, Mr. Paulson started his firm in 1994 but labored in relative obscurity for years. A merger-arbitrage specialist, Mr. Paulson churned out respectable gains betting on companies likely to see previously announced mergers completed or receive higher takeover bids, considered among the safest forms of investing.In early 2006, Mr. Paulson, then 49, became focused on the spectacular surge in U.S. housing prices. Working with an analyst named Paolo Pellegrini, Mr. Paulson seized on the idea of buying credit-default swaps, a form of insurance, to wager against the riskiest mortgage debt.The trade paid off in spectacular fashion, netting $20 billion in profits for clients and employees in 2007 and 2008. Mr. Paulson’s personal tally for 2007 was nearly $4 billion, considered the largest one-year payout in the history of the financial markets.Mr. Paulson followed that trade with a prescient, early bet on gold, adding to his wealth. Investor interest surged and Paulson & Co. became one of the largest hedge funds in the world.Inconsistent and often disappointing performance soon ensued. Mr. Paulson shifted from his traditional strategy to invest in gold miners, banks, pharmaceutical companies and other kinds of companies, trades that sometimes didn’t work out.Two years ago, Mr. Paulson gained recognition for something very different: paying among the largest-ever personal tax bills. After deferring the bulk of his profits from his subprime-mortgage trade, he made federal and state tax payments of about $1.5 billion, a figure so large it dwarfed the maximum amount the Internal Revenue Service allows taxpayers to pay with a single check.Over the past years, Mr. Paulson has been regularly seen walking in Central Park. He has been a financial supporter and hosted a fundraiser for President Donald Trump. He remains a billionaire, but his firm has declined in prominence. Major recent holdings include Bausch Health Cos Inc., down nearly 40% so far this year, Horizon Therapeutics PLC, up approximately 53%, and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, up 30%.“With one chapter closing, a new one is beginning for me and I look forward to continuing as an active participant in financial markets,” Mr. Paulson wrote to his investors.Write to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.comCorrections & AmplificationsHorizon Therapeutics PLC is up approximately 53% this year, while AngloGold Ashanti Ltd is up 30%.

Wall Stree Journal,"Governor Andrew Cuomo holds a media briefing at 3rd Avenue office in New York City, June 24.PHOTO: LEV RADIN/ZUMA PRESSRegarding your editorial “Cuomo’s Covid Chutzpah” (June 27): The ordering of the quarantine for individuals coming from “hot spot” states for Covid-19 by the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut wasn’t the first such order of its kind and probably won’t be the last ordered by state governors. In defense of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Department of Health’s nursing-home directive of March 25 regarding the return of their residents from hospitals was a decision forced by the rapidly overwhelming demand for hospital space in New York for seriously ill patients at a time of evolving guidance regarding the management of these residents. The unfortunate result was a hard lesson learned by all. With the current spike in diagnosed cases and hospitalizations in many states and with the management of the pandemic in the hands of governors and mayors, the Journal needs to target the real issue: the continuing lack of accountable, well-informed, decisive science-based leadership at the highest federal level. If this abdication of responsible leadership continues, one wonders what the relatives and friends of the thousands of individuals who may have needlessly succumbed to this pandemic will be doing in November.Joseph A. Stankaitis, M.D., MPHHoneoye Falls, N.Y.The decision to continue the lockdown once the virus had failed to overwhelm the hospitals completely ignores the factual data developed since the pandemic’s inception regarding the heavy concentration of deaths in the higher age groups, the predominance of close, personal, indoor contact for transmission, the resistance of children to Covid-19 infection and transmission, and the proper weighing of the deaths resulting from the lockdown. When measured in terms of life-years lost, the lockdown may have claimed twice that of Covid-19, and the margin increases daily.In a Hoover Institution interview, Dr. Scott Atlas suggests that history will judge continuing the lockdown as the greatest mistake of public policy of our era in terms of the damage done and the time to recover.J. David HosfieldEugene, Ore.You describe Andrew Cuomo’s “chutzpah” like it’s a bad thing. As baseball pitching great Dizzy Dean (30 wins in one season, cover of Time Magazine) once said: “It ain’t bragging if you can do it.”I think Gov. Cuomo should start wearing a T-shirt with that quote emblazoned on it. Maybe all New Yorkers should—with the proceeds going to health-care workers.Back in March and April when President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and other government officials were giving contradictory advice and flawed suggestions, and we didn’t know whether the virus could seep under our front doors, Gov. Cuomo was the only one giving me daily, dispassionate and helpful advice along with easy-to-understand graphs and statistics. And any of the governors who early on were quick to point a finger at New York are merely getting a well-deserved New York-style poke in the eye in return.Les SeiferPrinceton, N.J.While New York was the first, and so far the worst, in case counts, it has a lower percentage of Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes than in many other states, including the very states held up as examples.There are valid reasons to take risks to reopen the economy, but we should be honest about the size and distribution of those risks.Ken FriedmanOshkosh, Wis.",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-the-whole-cuomos-managed-covid-well-11593637534
Wall Stree Journal,"NPC International Inc., the nation’s largest Pizza Hut and Wendy’s franchisee, filed for bankruptcy Wednesday and will put its burger restaurants up for sale as it continues to hold discussions over the fate of its pizza outlets.The company, which operates more than 1,200 Pizza Hut locations and about 400 Wendy’s Co. restaurants, had been struggling even before the coronavirus pandemic forced many of its eateries to close. The company nearly filed for chapter 11 earlier this year before a group of lenders threw it a financial lifeline.The company said the Pizza Hut chain has been a particular drag on NPC for years, amid steep competition from rivals and Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands Inc.’s reluctance to invest in the chain, according to a filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston.“The Pizza Hut business has especially been hurt by a brand image and product offering that lags behind its competitors,” said Eric Koza, NPC’s chief restructuring officer, said in court filings.MORE FROM WSJ PRO BANKRUPTCYSycamore Bids $540 Million for Ann Taylor, Other Ascena Brands November 26, 2020U.S. Found Not Responsible for Puerto Rico Bond Losses November 23, 2020Offshore Oil-Rig Operator Noble Cleared to Exit Chapter 11 November 23, 2020Nevertheless, if all goes well in bankruptcy, NPC intends to reorganize around its Pizza Hut eateries and emerge from chapter 11 under new ownership.NPC was in default on payments owed to the Pizza Hut parent when it filed for bankruptcy, court filings show. The franchisee has nearly $900 million in debt.A Pizza Hut spokesman said the bankruptcy should prove an opportunity to reduce NPC’s debt and make the business stronger. NPC’s Pizza Hut locations are open, he added.“We are working with NPC and its lenders to ensure that NPC’s Pizza Hut restaurants emerge from this process with the support they need to succeed,” he said.The Covid-19 pandemic affected Wendy’s and Pizza Hut outlets differently, Mr. Koza said.“After an initial sharp drop, the Pizza Hut business saw a substantial spike in pizza sales,” he said in a declaration filed with the court. “Conversely, the Wendy’s business saw initial decreases in sales as a result of dramatic decline in foot and drive-thru traffic.”Mr. Koza said the reversal of fortunes at the two chains was likely to be short-lived as Wendy’s business bounces back with the reopening of local and state economies.A Wendy’s spokeswoman said NPC’s locations performed well before the pandemic and they continue to generate sales that line up with U.S. averages. The restaurants remain open and NPC is current with its obligations to the chain, she said.“We expect that will continue, and we will stay closely coordinated and support them moving forward,” she said.A Wendy’s spokeswoman said NPC’s locations performed well before the pandemic.PHOTO: TNS/ZUMA PRESSThe Wall Street Journal reported this week that NPC was preparing to file for bankruptcy.Restaurants are grappling with additional costs due to the pandemic. NPC said in its filing that it is spending roughly $750,000 a month on virus-related safety measures and expects the costs to continue through the year-end.NPC has reached an agreement on a restructuring proposal with some of its lenders. Under the proposed deal, the company will market its Wendy’s unit and will consider selling the locations as a whole or in pieces, seeking bids within three months.The company plans to pursue a sale of some of its Pizza Hut units within three to four weeks if it doesn’t reach a deal with Yum and certain creditors. NPC, founded in 1962, was one of the first franchisees of Pizza Hut restaurants.A slimmed-down business would hold on to a number of Pizza Hut restaurants, with senior lenders swapping their claims for equity in the reorganized NPC, according to a term sheet outlining a potential restructuring plan filed with the court.New money would be raised by a rights offering of at least $100 million, open to senior lenders and backed-stopped by an ad hoc lending group supporting the restructuring pact.NPC’s existing equity will be canceled under the proposed restructuring agreement, according to court papers.The franchisee is owned by Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and insurer Group One Thousand One LLC. Both Mr. Boehly and Dan Towriss, Group One Thousand One’s chief executive, are alumni of Guggenheim Partners.NPC has filed procedural motions with the court to allow it to continue operating during the chapter 11 case.

Wall Stree Journal,"Job seekers at a fair in Gardena, Calif., May 6.PHOTO: CHRIS CARLSON/ASSOCIATED PRESSPeter Q. Blair and Shad Ahmed make a good point about the need to focus on required job skills rather than emphasizing college degrees as a condition of employment (“The Disparate Racial Impact of Requiring a College Degree,” op-ed, June 29). Leave aside the fact that many high schools today don’t prepare students for even the fundamental three Rs they’ll need to function as productive adults.Historically, the reason for an employer’s emphasis on a degree was simply its bottom line. Requiring a particular degree provided a low-cost employment application-filtration system that eliminated the need to hire extra human-resources staff to process and interview a higher number of applicants. It also reduced the probabilities of discrimination charges. Companies accepted that this policy might result in their missing a good employee or two, but it was an acceptable trade-off.If the authors wish truly to aid the achievement of a tangible result, they should come up with specific recommendations on how employers can use technology to hire for skills and work experience without increasing recruitment costs.Will C. WoodMenlo Park, Calif.Promoting workers based on job skills and performance without favoring employees who have a college degree isn’t necessarily a bad idea, but it reflects a broader trend toward elevating diversity and inclusion as goals that transcend measurable standards of achievement. If there is racial disparity in standardized test scores in grade school, the tests must be flawed and ought to be eliminated. The same goes for SAT scores in college admissions. Until a better racial balance can be achieved in college graduations, corporations can do their part in offsetting privilege by playing down the importance and benefits of a college degree.Instead of addressing the root causes (e.g., poor public schools, single-parent families) of racial disparities in academic achievements, it is easier to ignore achievements and focus on other criteria for advancement in the workplace.There are countless inspiring stories of Americans without college degrees who succeeded beyond their wildest dreams and helped make American what it is today. Maybe Harvard should lead the way by no longer favoring faculty applicants who have college degrees and student applicants who have high-school diplomas.Adam GrahamCharleston, S.C.The authors’ unstated basic premise assumes 11 million unfilled high-wage jobs are available for those currently situated in low- and middle-wage jobs. It’s more likely that there is a limited number of high-wage jobs available and that the market has efficiently set the wage based on the supply/demand curves. Were this not the case, there would be a crowding out of those high-wage earners by the equally qualified low- and middle-wage workers resulting in a decline in the high wages.Mike FinneganMedia, Pa.The functionally unjustified requirement of college education imposed by many employers has a negative effect on the majority without college degrees. Remedying this situation would also release higher education from serving as the exclusive conduit to obtaining better paying jobs. Education could then better serve the course of broadening and deepening the individual, thereby achieving social and economic goals.Jack KaczorowskiLos Angeles",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-degrees-race-and-better-paid-jobs-11593637469

Wall Stree Journal,"Some specialty finance companies that lend to midsize businesses are confronting the threat of a funding squeeze just as the coronavirus pandemic is causing defaults to rise, a potential one-two punch that could curtail their activities.In the past seven weeks, two prominent companies that lend to middle-market businesses, Bain Capital Specialty Finance Inc. BCSF -0.17% and Golub Capital BDC Inc., GBDC -0.85% have both raised money by completing stock sales at significant discounts to their net asset values. Such a sale is typically seen as a sign of stress in the industry.BCSF revealed in its latest earnings report that a March 31 amendment to one of its bank facilities made it an event of default if a stock offering by the company wasn’t in the works by the end of June 22. BCSF declined to comment.The firm is also among a handful of middle-market lenders that have recently issued bonds at high interest rates. Others include Antares Holdings LP and FS KKR Capital Corp. FSK 0.05%The pressure on publicly traded business-development companies, or BDCs, and private-debt funds that often invest alongside them comes after years of rapid growth that was driven in large part by investors’ search for returns in an era of ultralow interest rates.Total assets under management in private-debt and direct-lending funds had grown to more than $740 billion by the end of September from about $125 billion in 2006, according to Preqin, a research firm.Similar to some other types of asset managers, middle-market lending companies typically rely on credit lines from banks to help fund their investments. Such debt carries low interest rates and can boost lenders’ returns during good times.There is a flip side, though. In stressed environments such as the current one, banks can lower borrowing limits and demand additional collateral, or cash, if assets lose value. Lenders can also be squeezed from both sides if their own portfolio companies rush to draw down credit lines, which happened in March.“These capital structures can only handle so much loan-value deterioration,” said Finian O’Shea, a BDC analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. The lenders that raised cash may not have violated any terms in their credit facilities, but “the reason they did those things is to relieve that potential pressure,” he said.Lenders that are worried about their standing with banks are less likely to make new loans to businesses ranging from regional restaurant chains to upstart software companies, analysts said. But efforts to address the problem, such as stock sales, can lower returns for investors.BDCs that have raised money recently have generally said they were being prudent as they faced the uncertainty generated by the coronavirus pandemic.Golub Capital BDC “is not facing nor has it ever faced any pressure from lenders to raise capital,” Chief Executive David Golub said. GBDC and Golub Capital, its affiliated private-debt fund manager, “are enviably positioned with more than $5 billion of dry powder available for new middle market loans,” he added.Dan Pietrzak, co-president and chief investment officer of FS KKR, said, “We were able to issue into a challenging market early in the second quarter and further enhance our strong liquidity with only a nominal increase to our overall cost in debt.”Middle-market lenders don’t often face this kind of financing challenge. Assuming the role of banks, many make most of their loans directly to companies, often to fund private-equity buyouts. They then hold those loans for their duration.The credit lines they obtain from banks can differ. A standard arrangement allows the specialty lenders to assess the value of their hard-to-price loans themselves. But when something happens to call into question a borrower’s financial health, the power to value the loan can shift to the bank. These so-called value-adjustment events can range from a large increase in debt relative to earnings to a delayed earnings report.STAY INFORMEDGet a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here.Value-adjustment events have already started to pick up and could accelerate in the coming months after borrowers report earnings for quarters that fully reflect the impact of the pandemic, industry insiders said. Moody’s Investors Service has estimated that the trailing 12-month default rate for speculative-grade corporate loans and bonds will rise to just over 12% at the end of the year, from 4.7% at the end of March.Ironically, some lenders that take a conservative lending tack may be more exposed to funding challenges, analysts said.The BDCs of Bain and Golub, for example, fill the vast majority of their portfolio with loans that have priority status in a bankruptcy. Such loans are treated by banks as more valuable collateral than junior loans, but they also tend to yield less than lower-ranking debt. That provides an incentive to borrow more with cheaper debt backed by specific assets rather than unsecured bonds, which carry higher interest rates.The drawback of this strategy is that it leaves such lenders with fewer so-called unencumbered assets that could be added as collateral elsewhere, if needed.As of March 31, unsecured borrowings accounted for just 13% of GBDC’s outstanding debt and 1% of BCSF’s debt—though BCSF later increased its unsecured debt with a $115 million bond sale. Their other borrowings came in the form of credit lines from banks and collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, another type of secured debt.By comparison, Ares Capital Corp. ARCC 0.18% —the largest BDC by net assets—had 56% of its debt in the form of unsecured and convertible bonds.Shares of Bain’s BDC have dropped 44% this year as of Wednesday, while shares of Golub’s BDC have slid 35%, according to FactSet. Ares Capital’s shares are down 21%.Jerry DeVito, a managing director at the private-credit firm Owl Rock Capital Partners who helps lead the firm’s funding strategy, said he expects private-debt managers to try to refine bank facilities in the future so they can better withstand pandemic-like shocks.“Borrowers are going to say I learned another lesson about what can go wrong—we need to revisit some aspects of how these structures work,” he said.Owl Rock Capital Partners manages the second-largest BDC by net assets, Owl Rock Capital Corp., which had 40% of its debt in the form of unsecured instruments as of March 31.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com and Sebastian Pellejero at sebastian.pellejero@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/specialty-lenders-face-funding-challenge-as-covid-19-boosts-defaults-11593595805
Wall Stree Journal,"LOS ANGELES—For most of the spring, California was a coronavirus success story. Now, just weeks after it began to reopen, new cases of Covid-19 are exploding across America’s most populous state, and public officials are quickly retrenching.On Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a slew of new restrictions, including the mandatory closure of many bars and indoor restaurants, an effective admission that, after proceeding slower than other states in the early months of the outbreak, California reopened too quickly.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSShould plans around reopening be made at a county, state or federal level? Join the conversation below.Nearly 6,000 people tested positive for the new coronavirus in California Tuesday, and more than 7,000 on Monday, the highest total during the pandemic and a 45% increase over the previous week. Hospitalizations are up more than 50% from two weeks ago. The percentage of tests coming back positive was 6% on Tuesday, up more than a full percentage point from two weeks earlier.Los Angeles County, home to 10 million of the state’s 40 million people, recorded nearly 2,800 new infections Tuesday and a record 2,903 on Monday. Sacramento County was almost out of open ICU beds Wednesday. In Imperial County, in the southeast of the state, patients are being transferred elsewhere because the local health system is overloaded.The closures announced Wednesday by Mr. Newsom, which also include movie theaters, zoos and museums, apply to 19 counties that together account for 70% of the state’s population. They follow the Democrat’s order earlier this week for bars in seven of those counties to close.At a news conference, Mr. Newsom expressed confidence the state could get the virus under control again.“We were able to bend the curve in the state of California,”he said. “We’re going to bend this curve again.”Public-health experts, however, said California may have already squandered the work it did to control the pandemic in March and April by devolving too much control over reopenings to counties.“I have been baffled by California, as well as what’s happening locally in L.A.,” said Ashish Jha, a professor of health policy at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He added there was “no medical rationale” for letting the state reopen so quickly. “I’m surprised. Gov. Newsom seemed like he understood the data and basic science.”Daily Covid-19 CountsAs Western states have moved through phases of reopening, some still see increases in cases.Reopening started*California8,000Los AngelesCounty7,000Others6,0005,0004,0003,0002,0001,0000MayJOregon1,0005000MayJuneWashington1,0005000MayJuneNevada1,0005000MayJuneColorado1,0005000MayJune*Based on when restrictions started easingSources: Johns Hopkins University (cases); state governments (reopening dates)In a sign of how their fortunes have reversed, New York, the state hit hardest by the virus in the spring, said Tuesday that travelers from California, along with other states where cases are growing such as Arizona and Texas, would have to quarantine for 14 days upon arriving.Mr. Newsom didn’t respond to requests for comment. In recent news conferences, he has defended the state’s policies on reopening, noting the costs of a continuing shutdown in a state where unemployment hit 16.3% in May, the sixth highest in the nation. “You can’t be in a permanent state where people are locked away,” he said on June 15.“As we reopen our economy, as more people are mixing, we’re going to see an increase in spread,” Mr. Newsom said Wednesday. He added that the earlier work to slow the virus had bought the state time to build capacity to deal with the surge it was now seeing.Through the early months of the outbreak, California took a cautious approach. Mr. Newsom was the first governor to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. In early May, as other states were reopening, he told Californians to wait.With case counts stable, however, pressure soon began to mount on Mr. Newsom. Several counties began allowing businesses to reopen, in defiance of state rules. Sheriffs in Riverside and Orange counties said they wouldn’t enforce social-distancing regulations. Lawsuits challenged the state’s ban on churches gathering in person.In some respects, public-health experts said, California’s early success controlling the virus worked against it. While those in the Northeast felt the brunt of Covid-19 deaths in the spring, on the West Coast the economic effects of the lockdown were more painful.Gov. Gavin Newsom faced pressure to reopen. Here, people gathered to protest the coronavirus lockdown in Sacramento in April.PHOTO: JOSH EDELSON/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES“People started to relax,” said Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. “They were saying, ‘We can’t take it anymore. We don’t know anybody with Covid. We’re going out.’”On May 7, Mr. Newsom announced a system for counties to reopen one-by-one, in stages, if they hit certain metrics, including stable hospitalizations and limits on the number of new cases.Related VideoFauci Warns Coronavirus Cases Could Reach 100,000 a DayDr. Anthony Fauci told a Senate committee Tuesday that coronavirus cases in the U.S. could “go up to 100,000 a day” if people continue to flout advice on social distancing and face masks. Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg NewsWithin weeks, the majority of counties were reopening, at the same time that Black Lives Matter protests drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets. With counties making their own rules on reopening, what was permitted varied wildly from one part of the state to another. The variance had little relationship to infections, hospitalizations or death statistics.San Francisco, where infection rates have stayed comparatively low, hasn’t reopened bars or gyms and recently put plans to reopen barber shops and nail salons on hold. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County opened bars even as its case numbers were climbing. Some 500,000 people visited county bars on June 20, one day after they reopened, according to county officials.STAY INFORMEDGet a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here.Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County public-health department, said that in retrospect, the county opened bars too early. But neighboring areas had done so, she said, and the state’s policy of allowing counties to manage their own reopening timelines put pressure on those that wanted to move slowly to keep up with those moving faster.“Everyone around us was already open,” Dr. Ferrer said. “It’s very confusing for people if you say an activity is safe in one county and not another.”Mr. Newsom, on Wednesday, defended the policy of allowing counties to reopen at different rates. The state government, he said, was imposing restrictions “on local parts of the state where we’re seeing an increase in community spread…not every part of the state is affected equally.”State enforcement hasn’t always lined up with where the virus was spreading fastest, however.As of Tuesday, 8.2% of coronavirus tests in Los Angeles County were coming back positive over the previous seven days, according to state data. Mr. Newsom ordered bars there to close on Sunday. But in neighboring Riverside County, state officials only recommended that bars close, even though the rate of positive tests there is 11.7%. Riverside officials ordered bars to close a day after Mr. Newsom’s recommendation.State officials said that once a county began falling short of the required metrics, it was put on a watch list, and had 14 days to improve before the state would reimpose restrictions.Early in the outbreak, Mr. Newsom and the Democratic governors of Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Nevada agreed to coordinate their responses to the coronavirus.The governors’ chiefs of staff hold conference calls each Friday, in which they discuss their numbers and strategies. Four of the five states have adopted a similar county-by-county approach to reopening, and four now require masks statewide.“It’s a shared approach, but individual paths moving forward,” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said.But as numbers have risen, some states in the pact responded faster than others. Oregon, where infection rates were lower than in California, paused its reopening on June 12, the same day California allowed counties to enter a new phase of reopening.For local officials who have tried to proceed cautiously, the county-by-county approach has been frustrating. Sara Cody, the public-health officer in Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, repeatedly warned state officials they were moving too fast. In the past three days, Santa Clara’s coronavirus hospitalizations grew 24%, according to state data updated Wednesday.“The virus doesn’t stay within a boundary,” said Jeff Smith, the Santa Clara County executive.—Alejandro Lazo and Lukas Alpert contributed to this article.Write to Ian Lovett at ian.lovett@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-success-against-the-coronavirus-turned-to-crisis-in-california-11593606600
Wall Stree Journal,"Nothing about summer in 2020 feels normal. There’s no baseball yet, no outdoor festivals, no live music. Depending on where you are, you may or may not be able to dine outside with friends; beaches are another maybe. Music has typically been a public soundtrack during the warmest months, blaring out of windows, rumbling from cars, echoing through parks, and this year there’s been a lot less of it.But 2020 has been filled with excellent new releases. What follows is a collection of some of the best of the tunes. They include hits that are reaching the peak of their popularity, some lesser-known tracks that in other years would have been the centerpiece of party playlists, and a few quieter songs that reflect the pensive mood of this summer. Think of it as a mixtape, one that begins on a celebratory and escapist note and gradually finds its way back to Earth.We start with “Break My Heart,” a surging single from London singer Dua Lipa’s “Future Nostalgia.” It’s dance music that understands the power of the riff—check the interpolation of INXS’s “Need You Tonight”—and it distills Ms. Lipa’s relentlessly catchy work to its essence.A new album from Drake is coming later this summer, but to tide fans over he issued the odds-and-ends collection “Dark Lane Demo Tapes” in May. “Toosie Slide,” a new song from the set, topped the Hot 100, but despite the streaming bounty and social-media virality, the wispy production lends it a lonely undercurrent.At the other end of the emotional spectrum is “Yo Perreo Sola” by Puerto Rican singer and rapper Bad Bunny, born Benito Ocasio. The track embodies his style, playful and bursting with color, mixing the stutter-step beat that defines Latin trap with singalong choruses.The original version of hip-hop artist Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage” comes from her March EP “Suga,” but it took off when Beyoncé jumped on the remix at the end of the following month. The production is hyper-minimal, just electronic percussion and a keyboard line that alternates between two notes, which leaves plenty of room for Megan and Beyoncé to trade sharp lines filled with attitude, the latter showing off her underrated skill as a rapper.For “Tap In,” emerging rapper Saweetie, born Diamonté Harper, borrows a beat from legendary Oakland emcee Too Short to showcase her own lyrical prowess. Ms. Harper, who also grew up in the Bay Area, has a highly musical rhyming style and a Missy Elliott-like ability to bend repeated vowels and phrases into hooks.The rubbery bassline of Jessie Ware’s “Ooh La La” sounds like a funky collision between Queen’s “Another One Bites the Dust” and Chic’s “Good Times,” but the ear gravitates toward the English artist’s voice. She’s a vocal chameleon, able to tweak her style to fit in many contexts, from late-night R&B to indie pop. Here, she ably plays the part of the confident disco queen.“Rain on Me,” a duet between Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, finds the two divas meeting on a propulsive French house banger. Ms. Grande’s voice is mellifluous and clarion while Gaga growls and implores, and the turnaround when the verses meet the chorus is the stuff of dance-floor heaven.Welsh singer and producer Kelly Lee Owens, whose second album, “Inner Sound,” is due in late August, specializes in tracks that move between conventionally pretty songs and stark dance music that pushes everything but the beat to the background. The first half of “Night” is pure dream pop, dominated by her soft, reverb-drenched voice, and then the throbbing kickdrum takes it to a much darker place.Mark Speer and Laura Lee of KhruangbinPHOTO: LAURENT GILLIERON/EPA/SHUTTERSTOCKKhruangbin is a three-piece band from Houston that sounds like a hip-hop DJ’s ultra cool and obscure record collection brought to life. “Pelota,” a highlight from the group’s recent album “Mordechai,” is a hypnotic slice of hallucinogenic Latin pop that features vocals from bassist Laura Lee.Like Khruangbin, Brooklyn singer-songwriter Nick Hakim brings classic sounds of the past into the present. “Qadir,” a lament for a friend who died young, is an atmospheric ballad that channels early-’70s soul and is inflected with psychedelia.In the first half of this year, singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers seemed to show up everywhere, adding vocals to excellent records by the 1975, Hayley Williams and Perfume Genius. The guest spots built anticipation for her second album, “Punisher,” out now, and “Graceland Too” is one of its best songs. On an arrangement flecked with violin and banjo, Ms. Bridgers narrates a tale of a woman recovering from a mental breakdown who drives to Memphis in search of an epiphany.Just this week Bill Callahan, who makes rustic, acoustic indie rock, released “Pigeons,” the first track from his forthcoming album “Gold Record.” Over plucked guitar and brushed drums, with an occasional horn section, it tells the story of a limo driver ferrying newlyweds to their honeymoon, thinking about man’s place in the universe and the power of love. It’s a ruminative and slow-burning song perfect for gazing out a window, which makes it a fitting way to end a mix during the sedentary summer of 2020.—Mr. Richardson is the Journal’s rock and pop music critic.

Wall Stree Journal,"In a new era of tighter Chinese government control of Hong Kong, the city is likely to see the sun set on broad media freedoms.Unlike mainland China, where apart from a few outliers all media is government-controlled, Hong Kong has had a vibrant press. Since the 1997 handover to Chinese control, journalists there have for the most part been able to report and write freely, without fear of intimidation or legal repercussions.That is changing overnight, with a Beijing-imposed security law that has sent chills through civil society, including the media industry. In addition to storied local newspapers such as the South China Morning Post, many of the world’s largest news organizations have regional hubs in the city.The full text of the law, released late Tuesday, requires Hong Kong authorities to strengthen regulation of the media and internet, as well as to promote national security through those channels. It also blocks media and the public from certain court trials, including those involving state secrets and public order.More broadly, the law empowers Beijing to deploy state-security agencies and to establish a bureau overseeing national security in Hong Kong. The law specifically delegates to the new bureau the job of strengthening management of foreign news organizations.China observers say authorities would be able to use the law as cover to harass and punish journalists whose coverage runs afoul of Beijing. They say Beijing could apply the law broadly because definitions of the four crimes laid out in the text—secession, subversion, terrorist activity and collusion with a foreign country—are left vague.“It’s much worse than the worst we could expect,” said Cédric Alviani, East Asia bureau head at the nonprofit Reporters Without Borders, or RSF. He says standard journalism work like interviewing a pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong or taking a picture of a protester vandalizing public property could be construed by authorities as promoting insurrection.“We can’t say that it kills press freedom in Hong Kong but it’s killing the principle of press freedom that was enshrined in the Basic Law,” he added, referring to Hong Kong’s de facto constitution since 1997.Also under the law, Chinese authorities could penalize a journalist for comments or actions made outside of Hong Kong as long as they see them as endangering Chinese national security, analysts say.Related VideoHong Kong Police Make First Arrests Under Newly Imposed Security LawHong Kong police clashed with demonstrators and made their first arrests under a new national-security law, apprehending protesters for allegedly carrying pro-independence signs as the city marked the anniversary of its handover to China. Photo: Roy Liu/BloombergScrutiny and pressure on journalists in Hong Kong have intensified since mid-2019, when pro-democracy protests took off and media outlets offered up a vivid picture of rioting by protesters and heavy-handed responses by the Hong Kong police.Jimmy Lai, founder of a popular newspaper known for criticizing and mocking China’s leaders, was arrested in February and expects to be targeted under the new law. He faces police charges of illegal assembly and intimidation over last year’s protests. In May, the Hong Kong police detained reporters and used pepper spray in order to deter reporting at protest sites, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.Hong Kong media tycoon and Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai expects to be targeted under the new law.PHOTO: VINCENT YU/ASSOCIATED PRESSThe tougher stance is part of a broader assault by the Communist Party on the media within its territory. RSF estimates that most of around 114 journalists currently detained in mainland China were accused of crimes related to national security. In addition, waves of foreign journalists were expelled earlier in the year.By some counts, the space for free press in Hong Kong has gradually narrowed in recent years. The financial territory ranks 80 among 180 countries and territories in RSF’s press-freedom index, down from 51 in 2008 and 18 in 2002, when the nonprofit began its ranking. China is placed at 117.In 2018, in a watershed moment for Hong Kong, authorities effectively expelled a British journalist after he hosted a press-club talk by an activist calling for the territory’s independence, a relatively fringe view even in Hong Kong but a red line for Beijing.Victor Mallet, now writing for the Financial Times in Paris, said that he viewed himself as “tiny collateral damage in the early stage of China’s crackdown” and that now, under the new law, his involvement could be explicitly labeled as a serious offense. At the time, the city’s immigration authorities didn’t give a reason for not renewing Mr. Mallet’s visa.Speculation about the new law’s impact quickly rippled through the industry.“The mood is very bad, particularly for local staff,” Chris Yeung, a veteran Hong Kong political writer and chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, said on Wednesday. While foreigners are more likely to face expulsion from Hong Kong than be charged under the law, Hong Kong citizens could face more severe consequences, he said.Free Speech Under Siege as Hong Kong TV Show Comes to EndUnder pressure from China, Hong Kong has been chipping away at the territory’s free speech, which is a key pillar of the city’s identity.

Photo/Video: Clément Bürge/WSJMr. Lai’s Apple Daily plans to take more bylines off stories that might trigger scrutiny under the national security law, although it plans to continue its coverage as before, according to Mark Simon, a senior executive at the outlet’s publisher, Next Media.Like most organizations, Apple Daily, a pro-democracy tabloid founded in 1995, has been telling its reporters to be more careful when covering the Hong Kong protests. With Beijing encroaching on Hong Kong’s autonomy before the new law came into effect, Mr. Simon says that dozens of its journalists in Hong Kong are looking into leaving.Also on Wednesday, continuing a media standoff with the U.S., the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it is requiring four U.S. media outlets to disclose detailed information about their mainland operations.The Associated Press, United Press International, CBS News and National Public Radio must declare their personnel and property in China, ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said. He said the measures were meant to counter the U.S. designation last month of four major Chinese state media outlets as foreign missions, describing them as “necessary countermeasures and completely justifiable defenses.”The four outlets have until July 7 to turn over the information.In connection with revoking the press credentials of reporters from The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post earlier this year, China ordered the newspapers and two other media outlets—Voice of America and Time magazine—to submit information about staff, finances, operations and real estate in China.Write to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-orders-four-u-s-media-outlets-to-provide-information-on-china-operations-11593595781
Wall Stree Journal,"The S&P 500 rose in the first session of July after data showed the labor market continued to improve last month.The nonfarm private sector created 2.4 million jobs in June, with 70% of new jobs in the leisure, hospitality, trade and construction industries, according to the ADP National Employment Report.YOUR MONEY BRIEFINGAfter Strong Quarter, Where Is Wall Street Headed Next?bb0282a3-e4cb-42ba-9988-2f3df57fd912@1.00xCreated with sketchtool.00:001xSUBSCRIBE“The first half was surprise after surprise,” said Lindsey Bell, the chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “Now we’re starting to get surprises to the upside. I think the second half will be all about making sure that the recovery continues at a solid clip.”The S&P 500 climbed 15.57 points, or 0.5%, to 3115.86, after rising 20% over the past three months for its best quarterly performance since 1998. The rally was fueled by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive support for financial markets and signs of an early recovery in economic activity.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 95.86 points, or 1%, to 10154.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 77.91 points, or 0.3%, to 25734.97.In another piece of encouraging economic data, the Institute for Supply Management’s June manufacturing index rose to 52.6 from 43.1 in May. That was better than consensus expectations. Numbers above 50 indicate expansion.That followed similar results in the overseas surveys. Factories in Asia and Europe continued their return to normality in June as restrictions designed to contain the coronavirus were lifted, according to surveys of purchasing managers. Manufacturing sectors returned to growth in a number of countries, including France, the U.K., Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia and Ireland.Whenever stocks have the kind of quarter they just had, the following quarter tends to be a strong one as well, said Frank Cappelleri, the executive director of Instinet. The last seven times the S&P 500 rose 15% in a quarter, it rose an average of 9.5% in the next quarter, he said.This volatile year makes predictions hard, of course. Mr. Cappelleri noted the market was largely rangebound for the past month and could remain so.“More of that is not the worst-case scenario,” he said.Ms. Bell of Ally agreed trading in the weeks and months ahead could be choppy as investors try to digest another earnings season, the pace of the recovery and the pandemic, as well as the search for a coronavirus vaccine.“On top of all that, they’re going to have to start thinking about what happens with the election,” she said.There were other upside surprises on Wednesday, too. FedEx shares jumped 12% to $156.66 after the company reported Christmas-like levels of spending in its latest quarter. FedEx said it is seeing tentative signs that the global economy is recovering from the pandemic.Shares of Pfizer rose 3.2% to $33.74 after the company reported promising results from a trial of its coronavirus vaccine candidate.Shares of YRC Worldwide surged 75% to $3.23 after the U.S. Treasury said it would lend the trucking firm $700 million in coronavirus stimulus funds.Tesla’s recent gains have made it the most valuable car company in the world by market capitalization. Shares of Tesla rose 3.7% to $1,119.63 on Wednesday, pushing its market cap to $207.66 billion, past Toyota Motor’s $201.99 billion market cap.In the afternoon, the release of the Federal Reserve’s minutes of its June meeting showed officials expect to keep interest rates near zero at least through 2022. Central bank officials at the meeting also reviewed how to design more support for the economy.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes ticked up to 0.682% from 0.653% on Tuesday.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress Tuesday that spending and other forms of economic activity have rebounded from lockdowns faster than the central bank expected. However, a second outbreak of coronavirus would undermine public confidence and jeopardize parts of the economy that rely on people gathering in groups, he added.Spending has rebounded faster than the Fed expected, said Chairman Jerome Powell.PHOTO: TASOS KATOPODIS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGESThe U.S. is now recording roughly 40,000 cases a day of coronavirus. New daily cases could hit 100,000 if people continue to flout advice on social distancing and face masks, Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease doctor, said this week.That’s led other investors to become more cautious about the outlook for the U.S. economy . High levels of saving suggest that the record jump in retail sales that took place in May is unsustainable, said Andrea Carzana, a fund manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.“I struggle to see that there won’t be a longer-term impact on consumers following the opening of the economy,” Mr. Carzana said. He added he expects defensive technology and pharmaceutical stocks to keep rising and shares that are sensitive to the state of the real economy, particularly those of banks, to retreat.Stocks rose in Europe after markets in much of Asia also closed higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.2% to 361.19. The gauge climbed almost 13% in the second quarter, after having seen 23% of its value wiped out in the first three months of the year.China’s CSI 300 index gained 2% to 4247.78 after a private gauge of manufacturing activity rose to a six-month high, boosted by increased domestic demand. Hong Kong’s stock market was closed for a public holiday.What PMI Numbers Won’t Tell YouIn recent years, purchasing managers indexes have become important indicators of where the global economy might be heading. But in the current slowdown, where small businesses were some of the hardest hit, PMI numbers may not be telling the full story. WSJ explains.

Wall Stree Journal,"Macy’s Inc. said nearly all its stores have reopened after a monthslong closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic, though the retailer warned it could take other measures as states tally more coronavirus infections.“While we do not expect another national shutdown, we do anticipate a regional impact as consumers are encouraged to stay home,” Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said Wednesday on a conference call to discuss Macy’s quarterly results. “Most of our stores are currently on reduced hours and will remain flexible to meet demand.”Many malls that house Macy’s department stores are closed or could be reclosed in areas with a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, a trend that could hurt store traffic, Mr. Gennette said. The reopening of urban stores could take longer as they are located in denser areas with higher risk of coronavirus transmissions, he added.Related VideoThe Economic Ripple Effect of Retail SalesAnalysts and economists are paying close attention to monthly retail sales numbers as a way to gauge how the economy may be recovering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Photo: Kathy Willens/Associated Press.The retailer, which like other businesses is impaired by the coronavirus-induced economic crisis, expects the pandemic’s effect to last for the remainder of the year, Mr. Gennette said. Macy’s stores were closed from March 18 through May 4 due to shelter-in-place measures across the country.The current wave of infections has hit many young people, some of whom took the end of stay-at-home orders as permission to resume their normal activities. States that recently eased lockdowns have moved to reimpose them, with several governors shutting down bars and limiting social gatherings again.MOREAnalysis: Macy’s Stores: Burden or Savior?The shopping experience entails adjustments as local economies reopen. Macy’s says it is installing plexiglass shields at checkout counters and increasing air ventilation in stores. Saks Fifth Avenue last week was among those that reopened stores in New York. Measures the Hudson’s Bay Co.-owned retailer took to make customer feel safe included ultraviolet handrail cleaners on escalators and a remote video-shopping service.For its fiscal first quarter ended May 2, Macy’s reported $3.02 billion in sales, down 45% from the year-earlier period. It swung to a loss of $11.53 a share, or $2.03 a share on an adjusted basis. The company said it booked $3.18 billion in impairment, restructuring and other costs due to the pandemic.Macy’s shares fell 4.4% on Wednesday.The company last week said it would lay off 3,900 corporate staffers, or 3% of its workforce excluding seasonal employees, as it strives to cut costs.Macy’s, which had been struggling before the pandemic, said in February that it planned to close a fifth of its stores over the next three years. The company employed 123,000 full- and part-time staffers as of Feb. 1, down from 166,900 five years earlier.Capri Holdings Ltd., the parent company of Versace, Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, is also eyeing store closures. Thomas Edwards, Capri’s finance chief and chief operating officer, said Wednesday that the company could close up to 170 stores, mostly Michael Kors, over the next two years as it seeks to streamline operations and improve profitability.Capri said 90% of its global stores have reopened. About 70% of its 455 stores in the Americas are open, with the rest expected to reopen by the end of the company’s fiscal second quarter. For its fourth quarter, which ended March 28, Capri swung to a loss of $3.69 a share on sales of $1.19 billion, down 11% from a year earlier.Other department-store chains have also taken a hit, with Neiman Marcus Group and J.C. Penney Co. having filed for bankruptcy protection. Retailers such as Coach parent Tapestry Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc. have moved to pare their workforces as the downturn sapped demand and profits.Even as stores reopen, retailers are likely to miss out on the usual bounty of the summer shopping period as travel restrictions remain in place world-wide.

Wall Stree Journal,"There’s rarely an easy time to become chief executive of an airline, in an industry with near-constant turbulence. Try doing it during a pandemic.United Airlines promoted Scott Kirby to CEO six weeks ago in a long-planned transition. He had already slashed schedules 88%—far more aggressively than competitors. He took on a lot more debt, mortgaging its frequent-flier program and selling new shares of stock to raise $10.65 billion in cash in addition to a $5 billion federal bailout. He never promised an empty middle seat, instead filling up the few planes United was flying, but was among the first to require mask-wearing onboard. United shares, up 38% through Wednesday since he took over May 20, have outperformed rivals Delta, American and Southwest.“You play the cards you are dealt,” Mr. Kirby, 52, an occasional poker player, says in his first newspaper interview since becoming CEO. He succeeds Oscar Munoz, who is now United’s executive chairman.NEWSLETTER SIGN-UPThe Middle SeatScott McCartney looks at the ups and downs of airline travel.PREVIEWSUBSCRIBEMr. Kirby is known more for quick, data-driven decisions than for nuance. But he also angered customers when United, which had pledged to be more customer-friendly after dragging a passenger off a plane in 2017, changed policies this spring to deny refunds and force vouchers for canceled flights.United’s rules changes violated Transportation Department regulations and left millions of customers with significant dollars locked up at United for canceled trips they might never reschedule. The changes were ultimately rolled back under pressure from customers, Congress and the DOT.United says customers who took vouchers for canceled flights can now get a refund if they prefer.“Recognize we were in a different environment where the normal refund policy was definitely not built for a pandemic,” Mr. Kirby says.The refund resistance came from a real worry that the airline would run out of cash. As United raised liquidity, and as it heard complaints from customers, it went back to its original policy.Mr. Kirby makes no apologies for changing rules to deny customers refunds for canceled flights.PHOTO: COOPER NEILL FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALDoes he regret the unfriendly customer change? Mr. Kirby says he is committed to doing the right thing for customers.“You have to judge decisions in the moment when you make them with what you know,” he says. “If we were doing it again, we know a lot more about it so we might make a different decision. But we just didn’t know much.”Research shows there are advantages to taking over in a crisis, says University of Colorado business school associate professor Stefanie K. Johnson, who studies leadership and is the author of the recent leadership book “Inclusify.”“People tend to view you as more visionary and charismatic and they are looking to you to create change,” she says. “So that gives you the opportunity to do it and have very strong support, assuming you have a very clear, compelling vision that you are communicating.”The downside, she says, is that success or failure may be determined by factors beyond the CEO’s capability—an economic collapse that cripples all airlines, for example.Dr. Johnson, a frequent United flier herself, says Mr. Kirby’s challenge will be in creating and communicating a compelling vision for both employees and customers.“Kirby could stand to be a bit more visionary than just action-oriented,” she says. “Especially in crisis, people need to understand where they are going because they feel so lost.”MORE FROM THE MIDDLE SEATHow the Biden Administration Will Tackle Travel November 18, 2020An Extra Covid Wildcard for Flying During Winter November 11, 2020How Coronavirus Ravaged Travel in 2020 November 4, 2020Airlines Have Rules About Face Masks—That’s Not Always Enough October 21, 2020Airlines Pitch Frequent-Flier Mile Deals to Wary Travelers October 14, 2020Mr. Kirby says he has come to understand that the pandemic has made his job more meaningful. Instead of plans to grow earnings and improve United’s product, running an airline now is about health and safety as well as survival of the company and its 88,000 jobs.“I hate being in this, but in a way it is energizing because the stakes are higher,” he says.Related VideoAir travel is full of opportunities for coronavirus transmission. Touchless check-in, plexiglass shields, temperature checks, back-to-front boarding and planes with empty middle seats are all now part of the flying experience, and the future may bring even more changes. Illustration: Alex KuzoianUnited has decided to beef up its schedule in August in recognition that there has been an increase in demand for summer travel. The airline plans to add nearly 25,000 more flights for the month than it will operate in July—about a 45% increase. But it will still be more conservative than competitors, operating only 40% of the flights it flew in August 2019. Business customers just aren’t flying, Mr. Kirby says.“The only strategy is to wait and be patient,” he says. “It’s great to be optimistic and it’s great to hope and want demand to recover, and we do, of course. But you also have to be realistic. People aren’t going to travel in the same volume and the same type of travel, until they feel completely safe, which probably means a vaccine.”SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSHow likely are you to fly United, or any airline, right now? Join the conversation below.United is at a disadvantage compared with competitors because its network is heavily oriented toward international flying, which has been hit harder than domestic trips. International cargo has mitigated the impact of a dearth of cross-border passengers, he says.The next reckoning for the airline industry may come Oct. 1. The federal bailout money required airlines to keep workers employed until Sept. 30. Without an additional bailout, massive furloughs could happen industrywide. While summer has brought some passenger traffic back, travel typically drops after Labor Day and this year it’s expected to plunge with a lack of business trips.Aboard airplanes, mask compliance is increasing, Mr. Kirby says. United put five customers on its no-fly list because they refused to wear masks onboard. They are banned until the airline no longer requires masks, which will probably be after a vaccine is widely available, he says.“While masks were controversial a few weeks ago, much less so today, and with our policy of willing to ban someone, we have very high compliance,” he says.The decision not to block middle seats “was an easy scientific call and a hard marketing call,” Mr. Kirby says. Was it the right call? “Yes. You can’t socially distance on airplanes. What makes an airplane safe is requiring a mask, air filtration and cleanliness onboard.”Mr. Kirby, who calls himself an amateur scientist and nerd who has been reading Scientific American since high school, lives on data. In February, when he charted the course of the pandemic, it seemed clear it would be world-wide and very difficult to stop, since the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic people. So United went into immediate worst-case scenario mode.“We’ve been realistic,” Mr. Kirby says. “If we bet the house on things improving tomorrow and we’re wrong, you put the company at risk.”Cleanliness changes that airlines are making will have to be permanent, he says. This won’t be the last virus, and customers will demand cleaner airplanes.But flying will be different in other ways, too. Mr. Kirby says United’s main priority when the industry rebounds will be paying down debt. That means the airline will keep flying older planes longer. Mr. Kirby says investment in other passenger areas will resume after the pandemic.For travelers, it will be more like the postrecession years of the past—you take the small improvements where you can.On Monday, Mr. Kirby approved putting ice back on airplanes and starting coffee and tea service.Write to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/flying-through-the-pandemic-with-the-new-united-ceo-11593612105
Wall Stree Journal,"Apple Inc. is temporarily closing dozens of stores in states around the country as the Covid-19 pandemic has worsened in certain regions.The company, which operates about 270 stores in the U.S., had been reopening them for business as coronavirus lockdowns eased in the spring.As of Wednesday, Apple had closed 16 locations in Florida, Mississippi, Texas and Utah, a spokesman said in an email. Ten of the closures were in Texas, where Covid-19 cases have surged.Apple will shut down 30 more locations by Thursday. Half of those locations are in California and the rest are in Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada and Oklahoma.California, Texas and Arizona all recently saw a record number of daily Covid-19 cases.Last month, the company closed seven stores in the Houston area, as well as two near Charlotte, N.C., one near Greenville, S.C., two near Naples, Fla., and six in Arizona.The latest Texas closures include stores in the Austin, Dallas and San Antonio areas.Apple initially closed stores in China, where the pandemic began.

Wall Stree Journal,"Struggling New York City bars and restaurants were dealt a blow Wednesday as officials delayed the start of indoor dining, citing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a press conference that indoor dining will be postponed indefinitely due to rising infection rates in other states, and a lack of compliance and enforcement of social distancing within the city.The third phase of reopening for the city is scheduled for July 6, which had originally included limited indoor capacity for restaurants, along with the restart of some personal care services such as nail salons.The rest of the city’s reopening scheduled for Monday will continue as planned, Mr. Cuomo said. Elsewhere in the state, indoor dining has resumed as the areas moved onto advanced phases of reopening.“This is a New York City-specific issue,” Mr. Cuomo said, adding that he would like to see stabilizing infection rates in other parts of the country, as well as better social distancing, before reintroducing indoor dining. “It will be postponed until the facts change and it is prudent to open.”Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he would like to see stabilizing infection rates in other parts of the country and better social distancing before reintroducing indoor dining.PHOTO: BYRON SMITH/GETTY IMAGESJames Mallios, owner of Amali Restaurant in Manhattan said he invested $20,000 in safety renovations and another $10,000 in physical upgrades in preparation for indoor dining. He said he also made two recent hires and was processing the paperwork for another 10-15 employees before the announcement Wednesday.“I’m kind of gobsmacked by this,” Mr. Mallios said. “I was predicating those decisions on the schedule that the state published.""Mr. Mallios said the location of his restaurant in a high-traffic area only allows for about two seats outside. He is considering demolishing a skylight in a back room of the establishment to accommodate open air seating, but is worried that the reopening requirements will change again.George Constantinou, who runs three restaurants in Brooklyn and one in New Jersey, said he was nervous about the addition of indoor dining, since many of his former employees have been reluctant to return to serve tables indoors.“I am a little relieved that it’s postponed so we can focus on outdoor dining,"" Mr. Constantinou said.Since the city started allowing outdoor dining, his restaurants have added about 10-15 tables at each location, Mr. Constantinou said, boosting sales by about 70% compared with delivery and takeout.On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the city will expand outdoor seating in lieu of adding indoor capacity, including outreach efforts beyond the 6,600 restaurants that have already introduced outdoor dining. “It is the time to double-down on outdoor dining,” he said.According to a survey from the NYC Hospitality Alliance, 36% of restaurants and bars in New York City didn’t pay rent in June.PHOTO: SPENCER PLATT/GETTY IMAGESAndrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a nonprofit association that represents restaurants and nightlife establishments, said while the industry understands the need for caution, restaurants and bars also will require financial assistance for rent and reopening costs, as well as more outdoor dining options to help offset their losses.“Many were hoping to reopen but there are also many concerns,“ said Mr. Rigie. “The only thing worse than restaurants not opening right away would be for them to reopen and then shut down shortly thereafter if there’s a spike in Covid.”According to a survey from the organization, 36% of restaurants and bars in the city didn’t pay rent in June. Out of 509 owners and operators surveyed, 90% paid half or less.Why Another Coronavirus Stimulus Package May Be Tough to CraftCongress is eager to pass the next phase of coronavirus stimulus legislation, but the bipartisan spirit that was present months ago may be frayed as both parties weigh their differences.

Wall Stree Journal,"The Great American Songbook has one definitive virtue: flexibility. For example, an Irving Berlin song like “Blue Skies” can be reconfigured rhythmically as a waltz, a polka, or a bossa nova, sound happy or sad. Appropriately, the leading interpreters of the songbook tend to place great emphasis on spontaneity and something akin to improvisation.In 1940, Nat King Cole, then an increasingly popular 21-year-old pianist, was hired to play on the soundtrack of “No, No, Nanette,” and he fell in love with its songs, by veteran tunesmith Vincent Youmans. Cole left us over a half-dozen versions of “Tea for Two” alone. One is a wonderfully spirited studio collaboration with the tenor-saxophone colossus Lester Young in 1942. Another is an ecstatically exciting free-for-all involving guitarist Les Paul and tenor saxes Illinois Jacquet and Jack McVea from the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concert in 1944. In still another, Nelson Riddle transformed the song into a piano concerto for Cole, which he played instrumentally on his 1955 album “The Piano Style of Nat King Cole.” And on the first episode of his 1956-57 NBC TV show, Cole finally sang “Tea for Two,” for what turned out to be the only documented occasion. A video montage, which contains two instrumental performances from the TV series (May 17 and Sept. 24, 1957), has the camera clearly focused where it should be—on his hands.Frank Sinatrawas invading the territory of soul crooners Ray Charles and James Brown when he recorded the blues-inflected “That’s Life” in 1966. To have a shot at the big sales, The Chairman recruited the most commercially oriented producer-arranger team he knew, Jimmy Bowen and Ernie Freeman. The move paid off, and the single made it to No. 4 on the pop chart.But when Sinatra sang it on his “Man and His Music” special that December, he commissioned a new arrangement from Riddle, his most celebrated collaborator. Where the hit single seems constricted, the Riddle version is much looser and more upbeat. Sinatra retains all of the aggressive energy of the record but has a lot more fun, joyfully recounting his having been “a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn, and a king.” He concludes with a resoundingly Louis Armstrong-inspired “Oh, Yeah!”First sung by Judy Garlandon her 1958 album, “Judy in Love,” her masterful performance of the classic love song “I Can’t Give You Anything but Love, Baby” is, in essence, a perfect five-way collaboration. The original words and music were by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, to which Garland’s mentor, Roger Edens, added a new, special material verse (which begins with “Now that it’s your birthday…”). Riddle supplied the inspired arrangement, which is by turns bluesy like Duke Ellington and impressionistic like Stravinsky—on martinis. Then it’s Garland herself who provides the sheer magic. The singer’s 1963 TV performance is more remarkable still—she takes the already long arrangement and makes it even slower and more romantic, stretching it out to sustain an almost unbearable degree of erotic tension. During the tenor sax solo, the camera lingers on Garland’s face, and she continues to “sing” even without words—communicating as much with her eyes as she had with her voice.Bobby Darin’s 1959 blockbuster hit single of “Mack the Knife” is the most significant record of the era between Elvis and the Beatles, speaking more eloquently than any other to both the nascent rock ’n’ roll generation and their parents. The song was also the most electrifying number in his musical arsenal, and he consistently found new ways to keep it fresh without seriously altering the original arrangement. In 1970 on “The Andy Williams Show,” Darin spikes his delivery with all kinds of asides: After the first eight bars, he unexpectedly starts counting, as if he’s marking time for his delayed re-entrance; then, after the second eight bars, he interjects, “Let it get good now!” It’s a testimony to Darin’s talent and to the tragedy of a life cut short—he died three years later, at age 37.Rock stars have always been drawn to the American Songbook—not always successfully. But Sinead O’Connor’s “Am I Not Your Girl?” is an under-appreciated gem. For this 1992 album, she made two smart moves. She recruited the storied arranger-conductor-pianist Torrie Zito (best known for his long collaboration with Tony Bennett) as her musical director. And she used Peggy Lee as her main source of inspiration, even on songs not recorded by Lee, like Rodgers and Hart’s 1940 classic “Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered.” Where this “Pal Joey” show tune is customarily an excuse for female singers to get simmeringly sexy, Ms. O’Connor is warm and vulnerable, proceeding with very convincing trepidation, as if she were the prey rather than the predator.One hidden Songbook jewel is “As Easy as Rolling Off a Log,” written in 1937 by M.K. “Moe” Jerome and Jack Scholl, and performed by trumpeter-singer Johnnie “Scat” Davis and comedienne Mabel Todd the next year on the soundtrack of “Katnip Kollege.” Over the generations, countless kids grew up with this Merrie Melodies cartoon—among them James Taylor, who has included “As Easy as Rolling Off a Log” on his album “American Standard,” which was released in February. Taylor interprets the song in the same folksy vernacular as his own classic originals, a guitar-centric, delightfully low-key interpretation further enhanced by the singer’s whistling and a midregister clarinet solo by Lou Marini.—Mr Friedwald writes about music and popular culture for the Journal and is the author of the newly-published “Straighten Up and Fly Right: The Life and Music of Nat King Cole.”",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-staying-inside-guide-infinitely-interpretable-11593635667

The probe was launched as a result of allegations that Wirecard could have been linked to a probable case of round-tripping, they said in a statement, where the money Wirecard paid the fund in the deal is alleged to have been paid back into Wirecard as revenue.The company’s market value has crashed to less than €600 million ($673 million) from nearly €13 billion on June 17, the day before it first revealed the cash was missing in one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years.The company owes about €1.3 billion in bank debt and has €1.4 billion of bonds outstanding.Wirecard and the Curious Case of the Missing $2 BillionPayment processing company Wirecard was the darling of Germany’s fintech industry until auditors uncovered a $2 billion hole in its accounting.

Wall Stree Journal,"SoftBank Group Corp. is looking to distance itself from Wirecard AG, after the Japanese tech conglomerate helped arrange a $1 billion investment months before the German payments company went bust.One of the world’s largest technology investors, SoftBank is seeking to terminate a five-year partnership its investment arm formed with Wirecard in April 2019, according to people familiar with the matter.Wirecard declined to comment.The partnership agreement called for SoftBank to introduce Wirecard as a digital payments provider to other companies in SoftBank’s sprawling portfolio of tech firms. SoftBank also agreed to help Wirecard expand in Japan and South Korea.RELATEDSoftBank’s $1 Billion Investment in Wirecard Came With a Twist (Nov. 14)The partnership was struck in April 2019 at the same time that a SoftBank-run investment vehicle agreed to plow €900 million ($1 billion) into Wirecard through a convertible bond. It was an unusual deal in which SoftBank ended up not putting in any of its own money when it closed later that year.Wirecard’s auditors revealed last month that $2 billion of cash on the company’s balance sheet probably didn’t exist. German prosecutors have accused its former chief executive, Markus Braun, of falsely inflating the company’s sales with fake income.The company filed for the German equivalent of bankruptcy protection last week.Wirecard continues to operate its payment-processing businesses.

WSJ explains what we know about the missing money, as investigators are still trying to understand what happened. Photo composite: George DownsThe convertible bond and the partnership with SoftBank were seen as a stimulus injection for Wirecard. In early 2019, its stock price was under pressure after a Financial Times article aired a whistleblower’s allegations of questionable accounting, which the company denied at the time. Wirecard announced the SoftBank partnership just as a government-imposed ban on short selling Wirecard’s stock expired.The first fruit of the partnership came in July 2019, when Wirecard said it struck a deal with AUTO1 Group, a European car-buying and -selling platform in which SoftBank had an investment.On an earnings call in August, Mr. Braun said Wirecard was in concrete discussions with half a dozen more SoftBank portfolio companies, and that the partnership would be “a strong positive catalyst” for the second half of 2019.“This partnership is really accelerating from zero to 100 in four seconds,” Mr. Braun said.That month, August 2019, Wirecard said it was exploring a collaboration with Oyo Hotels & Homes, and in March said it formed a partnership with Southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab Holdings. Both are backed by SoftBank.A spokesperson for AUTO1 Group said: “There is no cooperation with Wirecard. We had a phase of brainstorming, but it never went forward.” Oyo and Grab didn’t respond to requests for comment.The convertible-bond deal closed in September 2019. But SoftBank itself never contributed cash. The Wirecard deal was instead backed by a fund with commitments from Mubadala Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund, and SoftBank employees, who included Vision Fund executives Rajeev Misra and Akshay Naheta.But they then immediately sold most of the Wirecard exposure for an instant profit onto a new set of investors, via an exchangeable bond arranged by SoftBank’s financial adviser on the Wirecard deal, Credit Suisse Group AG. The bonds now trade for around 10% of their face value.Credit Suisse declined to comment.SoftBank said last week that it pushed for Wirecard to invite in outside auditors to do an independent investigation into allegations against the company.Appointing a special auditor “may help put the allegations behind the company once and for all and draw a line under the unwanted distraction that continues to plague the company,” SoftBank officials wrote in an email to Mr. Braun on Oct. 18, 2019, and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.SoftBank executives had grown wary of providing introductions between its portfolio companies and Wirecard, a person familiar with the matter said.On Oct. 21, Wirecard’s board appointed an outside auditor, KPMG, to probe the alleged accounting problems. In April, KPMG said there were obstacles in its investigation and it couldn’t confirm purported revenue, sending Wirecard shares sliding.Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-seeks-to-end-partnership-with-wirecard-11593627705
Wall Stree Journal,"New York City residents produce more than a billion gallons of sewage a day and nearly every toilet is connected to the public sewer system. That wastewater tells a story about the health of the city, and officials are hoping to use it as a new way to monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus.Officials for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection have in recent days honed a process that can detect the genetic material of the disease in wastewater. Analyzing the sewage, a process that the department regularly does, “could be a quick way to get ahead of outbreaks before people start showing up in emergency rooms,” said Vincent Sapienza, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection.More than 23,000 New Yorkers have died from Covid-19, including probable deaths, and more than 12,000 people were hospitalized with the disease during the peak of the crisis in mid-April. Researchers have determined that an estimated one in five New York residents have had the virus, which might have been introduced in the area earlier than the first reported case on March 1.Currently, around 1% of New Yorkers are testing positive for the disease, and New York City is set to enter the next phase of reopening on July 6. While in this lull, public-health experts, scientists and others are working to roll out new types of surveillance that can be used to help better determine public-health decisions if there is a resurgence of the disease.Scientists say that some people who have the novel coronavirus excrete some of the virus in their feces, even before symptomatic. Utilities all over the U.S. have started looking at whether sewage can yield useful information about outbreaks of Covid-19. The thought is that microbiologists can quantify the amount of viral material that is in a wastewater sample and health workers can look for hot spots.Left, a rig housing two containers is used to collect water samples at Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant. Right, a researcher handled samples of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to be tested at the microbiology lab.Testing wastewater for pathogens isn’t a new public-health strategy; it has been used to help stem polio outbreaks. Like other municipalities, in New York City the water is tested to remove pathogens at one of the city’s 14 wastewater treatment plants. And researchers have well-developed processes that detect some common viruses that cause gastrointestinal disease.What is new is developing a protocol for detecting the novel coronavirus in wastewater, and there are varying methods being developed quickly for a process that is accurate, fast and easily deployed.Generally, experts say, the process involves taking a wastewater sample, concentrating the genetic material in the sample, and extracting the viral genetic material, or RNA. The extracted viral RNA is reverse transcribed to DNA, and the amount of genetic material in the sample is then quantified. There is substantial variation in the laboratory methods scientists have been developing as standardization has just recently started.RELATEDNew York City Delays Indoor Dining as U.S. Virus Cases Keep RisingNew York City May Delay Indoor Dining Amid Coronavirus Surges in Many States (June 29)How Success Against the Coronavirus Turned to Crisis in CaliforniaBiobot Analytics in Cambridge, Mass., has developed one technology that is being used in 42 states. They provide weekly testing, according to a spokesman.Researchers at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and Syracuse University have developed another method—different from the method being used in New York City—that is being piloted in several counties and municipalities throughout the state.Tompkins County in the Finger Lakes region was among those in the pilot group. Frank Kruppa, Tompkins County public health director, said in a statement that the county was interested in the potential of the technology and welcomes a statewide effort for wastewater screening, which would “be important going forward.”A spokesman for the state Department of Health said analyzing wastewater is something the state is exploring. “Even though wastewater is not known to spread the virus, wastewater surveillance has the potential to provide a community-level indicator of the presence of Covid-19 that could help inform public health policy decisions,” he said.An engineer and sewage treatment worker removed a rig used to collect water samples from the Brooklyn and Queens waterways at the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Brooklyn.David Larsen, an associate professor at Syracuse University, said the goal is to get their system to a same-day protocol, where water levels could be refreshed daily so that public-health officials can make quick decisions about the levels of risk in the community.Dr. Larsen said the new technology will be implemented in Syracuse University dormitories this fall to test water leaving buildings. So long as it isn’t a dorm with 20,000 people, he said, the technology is there to know that one person is shedding the disease. With that knowledge, health workers could go to the dormitory and conduct screenings to see who needs health care.New York City officials determined that they needed their own custom method to detect coronavirus in wastewater. The city’s Newtown Creek Microbiological Laboratory is sophisticated enough to shepherd this work, officials said, though more equipment would allow for more testing.One specific complication, said Andrea Silverman, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering, who is working in partnership with the DEP, is that the city has a combined sewer system where sewage mixes with storm runoff that changes the flow rate and can dilute a sample. As different parts of the city reopen—like Midtown Manhattan—that can also change the water flow rate, she said.Pools of wastewater at Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Facility.Right now, according to Dimitri Katehis, director of regulatory compliance and innovation for the DEP, the city’s technology can determine the presence or absence of disease in wastewater, partly because the overall infection levels are so low.If there is a resurgence, Dr. Katehis said, the wastewater would show the different stages of infection. Creating this history of samples, including data from other municipalities, is critical to being able to support the city in the fall, he said.The city’s technology, however, isn’t yet able to estimate the number of people affected by the virus. That capability is still in the early stages.But, said Dr. Katehis, “part of the longer term plan is when we see a hit, to go upstream and do sampling at pump stations or regulator stations to allow us to provide more targeted info to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene so they can put additional resources in neighborhoods.”Related VideoThe Promise and Peril of Fast-Tracking Coronavirus Vaccine DevelopmentAs the coronavirus continues to spread around the globe, companies and academic labs are racing to develop a vaccine that would help society get back to normal.

Wall Stree Journal,"Lawyers for men claiming they were sexually abused by Boy Scouts of America volunteers as children said they suspect some local councils of the youth organization are moving assets out of their reach.The suspicion surfaced in a filing Tuesday in the bankruptcy court where the national Boy Scouts group sought protection from lawsuits related to decades of alleged sexual assaults.The bankruptcy has stopped hundreds of lawsuits blaming the national organization for failing to root out sexual predators from its ranks. An injunction extended the pause on litigation to the Boy Scouts’ many local councils, which operate troops scattered across the country and hold the bulk of the organization’s wealth.The local councils aren’t themselves bankrupt but are key players in the proceedings. The land and other property they hold could help fund a settlement with victims, but the councils say they are legally separate from the Boy Scouts and don’t share the national organization’s liability.MORE FROM WSJ PRO BANKRUPTCYU.S. Found Not Responsible for Puerto Rico Bond Losses November 23, 2020Offshore Oil-Rig Operator Noble Cleared to Exit Chapter 11 November 23, 2020Ruby Tuesday Gets Approval for Bankruptcy Sale Process November 20, 2020“Like other nonprofit organizations, local councils must effectively leverage their assets to meet their financial obligations and responsibilities to the communities they serve,” a spokesman for the Boy Scouts said. “It is part of councils’ normal course of operations to re-evaluate their real-estate holdings. Camp sales by local councils are not an uncommon occurrence and have taken place across many councils for decades.”Abuse victims have viewed the local councils as necessary participants in creating a compensation fund.But a committee of abuse victims said in court documents that local councils have been shedding assets. Some have sold properties and others are contemplating such sales, “presumably for the purpose of putting the real property beyond the reach of creditors,” the victims committee said.Chapter 11 stops litigation, but it obliges troubled businesses to safeguard their assets, with creditors’ interests in mind.One local council has said it intends to shift property to a foundation, “in return for no consideration,” according to the victims committee.The Boy Scouts organization filed for bankruptcy in February while admitting it had failed to protect boys from predators in its ranks. The goal of chapter 11, the Boy Scouts said, was to negotiate a settlement with sexual-abuse victims who might number in the thousands, without the pressure of defending hundreds of court cases.The local councils aren’t under a formal obligation to get court approval to sell their assets. They have until July 21 to decide if they want to cooperate in bankruptcy negotiations. If they choose not to cooperate, they could lose the protections of the injunction and be exposed to litigation again.While the national organization reports assets of $1.4 billion, recent tax filings of certain local councils show they hold $3.3 billion in real estate, cash and investments, according to the victim’s committee.The national organization has an interest in the holdings of the local councils and should be vigilant in preventing value from being moved out of reach of creditors, the victims committee said.For now, the Boy Scouts and lawyers for victims are mediating their differences, hoping to avoid a return to the courtroom.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/abuse-victims-suspect-boy-scouts-councils-of-moving-assets-out-of-reach-11593633310
Wall Stree Journal,"ISTANBUL—Seven Turkish defendants are due to stand trial here on Friday in what will be the first court examination of how one-time auto titan Carlos Ghosn used Turkey as a steppingstone late last year to reach Lebanon after fleeing Japan inside a musical equipment box.Wrapping part of their investigation despite the coronavirus outbreak, Turkish prosecutors have ordered an airline manager and four pilots to stand trial on charges of migrant smuggling. They are accused of arranging the private-jet flights that allowed Mr. Ghosn, who had been charged with financial crime in Japan and was living in a court-monitored Tokyo house, to reach Beirut from Osaka, making an undeclared layover at Istanbul’s Atatürk airport. Mr. Ghosn, who remains in Lebanon, has denied the Japanese allegations.Detained since early January and facing up to eight years in prison, the five men have denied any wrongdoing. The airline manager, Okan Kosemen, said he organized the late December flights without knowing that Mr. Ghosn would be on board. The pilots have said the responsibility of checking luggage contents and passenger documents lay on airport customs.While the former chief executive and chairman of Nissan Motor Co. has refused to give details about his escape, the Istanbul trial could help shed light on the kind of international back-office work that was necessary to pull off an operation that left Japanese authorities stunned. The trial will also highlight how Mr. Ghosn, who said he fled Japan because he didn’t feel that he was able to get a fair hearing there, left many people in the crosshairs of Turkish, as well as Japanese, authorities.Two female flight attendants, who weren’t in custody pending the Istanbul trial, face charges of concealing a crime and up to two years in prison. They have denied the charges, saying that they weren’t aware of Mr. Ghosn’s illegal transit through Turkey until the story appeared in the press.MNG Jet Havacilik A.S., the airline which Mr. Kosemen worked for and which operated the flights used by Mr. Ghosn, has said its aircraft were used illegally and is a co-plaintiff in the case.From the ArchivesGhosn: ‘Nissan Owes Me a Lot of Money’In an interview with WSJ’s Nick Kostov, Carlos Ghosn said he regrets not seizing a 2009 opportunity to work in the U.S., where he wouldn’t have been “crucified” for his pay. The former auto executive recently escaped Japan, where he faces charges of financial wrongdoing. Photo: Jacob Russell for The Wall Street Journal (Originally published Jan. 10, 2020)Turkish authorities have said that they suspect two Americans played a lead role in orchestrating Mr. Ghosn’s escape from Japan: Michael L. Taylor and George-Antoine Zayek. The two men helped Mr. Ghosn sneak onto a Global Express business jet at an Osaka airport by hiding him in a large box normally used for musical equipment, The Wall Street Journal reported shortly after the escape.But their case, as well as that of a Beirut-based broker suspected of booking the flights, was split from that of the seven Turkish defendants because prosecutors have yet to receive responses to requests for judicial assistance they sent to the U.S. and Lebanon, according to people familiar with the Turkish probe.One of the Americans targeted by the Turkish probe, the former Green Beret Mr. Taylor, sits 4,800 miles away from Istanbul, in a Massachusetts jail cell. He was arrested with his son in May by federal prosecutors acting on a request from Japan to extradite them for their alleged role in Mr. Ghosn’s flight.Through lawyers, Mr. Taylor and his son, Peter M. Taylor, have argued that they haven’t committed a crime under Japanese law and therefore shouldn’t be extradited to that country. They have also argued that they should be released on bail because at least 25 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus at the county jailhouse where they are being detained.In Turkey, the main piece of evidence was a pair of Penn Elcom flight cases, which investigators found in a hangar at Atatürk airport: a bigger one, with protective foam inserts and about 70 holes drilled at the bottom, and a smaller one filled with a loudspeaker, according to people familiar with the Turkish probe.Custom-made in Beirut, the boxes, together with a basic guitar stored in a premium protective case, were used by the elder Mr. Taylor and Mr. Zayek to pose as musicians when they went through security checks at the Osaka airport, with Mr. Ghosn hidden inside the bigger box, according to people familiar with the Turkish and Japanese probes.The audio-equipment case in which Carlos Ghosn was sneaked onto a private jet at an Osaka, Japan, airport on Dec. 29, according to people familiar with the Turkish probe. The case was found at the back of the cabin by the Istanbul-based plane operator.To ascertain that Mr. Ghosn could have squeezed inside the box, Turkish investigators asked a worker at the airport, who was about as tall as the 5’6” businessman, to step into the case, and concluded that a person could easily fit inside, the people familiar with the Turkish probe said.“They really went the extra mile,” one of the people said.As part of their investigation, the Turkish prosecutors also retrieved and analyzed hours of audio recordings from the aircraft used by Mr. Ghosn, as well as dozens of text messages exchanged between Mr. Kosemen, the MNG Jet manager; Nicolas Meszaros, the Beirut-based flight broker; and the plane crews in a bid to determine the degree of implication of each suspect, the people familiar with the probe said.Phone records helped prosecutors determine that Mr. Meszaros dealt directly with Mr. Kosemen to book two MNG Jet aircraft: the Global Express, to fly from Dubai to Osaka and from Osaka to Istanbul, and a smaller plane for the final Istanbul-Beirut leg.A review of Mr. Kosemen’s bank accounts showed cash inflows of 216,800 euros and $66,000 in the months preceding the flights, according to the people familiar with the probe. Mr. Kosemen told Turkish investigators that the money stemmed from bonuses paid to him by aircraft owners and that he received no profit from Mr. Ghosn’s flights with MNG Jet.Mr. Meszaros didn’t respond to requests for comment.The prosecutors were intrigued by a conversation over WhatsApp between one of the pilots and a flight attendant about a pricey catering order, which included duck breast and canapés, made ahead of Mr. Ghosn’s escape, the people familiar with the Turkish probe said. The prosecutors thought it might indicate that the crew knew that additional food would be necessary for an undeclared passenger, but eventually ruled that it was a candid exchange, the people said.Another WhatsApp conversation, however, between Mr. Kosemen and one of the pilots of the Osaka-Istanbul flight, reinforced their belief that cockpit crew knew that Mr. Ghosn was on board, the people familiar with the probe said.“The important cargo should stay at the back. Upon landing, I will welcome the plane,” Mr. Kosemen wrote in a message as pilots prepared to leave Japan, they said.“The separation door will be closed after takeoff, they don’t want to be disturbed,” one of the pilots responded.During questioning by Turkish prosecutors, Mr. Kosemen said he talked only briefly with Mr. Ghosn on board the plane they took together to fly from Istanbul to Beirut on Dec. 30, according to people familiar with the Turkish probe.“He didn’t tell me anything about the smuggling issue and I didn’t ask him anything,” the 48-year-old manager said, according to the people. “He only told me that Japanese are bad people.”—Nick Kostov in Paris contributed to this article.Write to David Gauthier-Villars at David.Gauthier-Villars@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ghosns-escape-from-japan-leaves-seven-facing-prison-in-turkey-11593634188
Wall Stree Journal,"After recovering rapidly from mid-April through mid-June the economy has shown signs of sputtering in the past two weeks.The flattening may reflect a pullback by consumers in states where cases of Covid-19 have shot up, the exhaustion of pent-up demand driven by stimulus checks, or simply a pause after the first wave of low-risk workplaces were allowed to reopen.Regardless of the reason, multiple data sources show that after an initial V-shaped plunge and partial rebound, activity has since flat-lined, resembling the reverse image of the square-root symbol (√).“It was a straight line up for the better part of two months,” said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies, a financial-services company that compiles a daily index of high-frequency data on mobility, jobs and other activity. “So this is definitely a notable slowdown that began around June 17th.”Recoveries seldom proceed in a straight line and it’s too soon to write this one off. Its path this time has been especially unpredictable because it depends on the pandemic and the social-distancing measures undertaken to halt its spread.From March until mid-April, the economy contracted at unprecedented speed as states ordered nonessential businesses to close and people to stay home. Then, daily cases and hospitalizations began to drop in the hardest-hit states and stimulus checks for up to $1,200 per adult arrived in bank accounts. In late April, some states began to lift restrictions and stores reopened. Spending, in particular by lower-income families, rose sharply, returning to prepandemic levels for some categories.In early June, cases began to rise in some states that had reopened early, notably Arizona, Texas and Florida. California, the first state to shut down, recently saw caseloads surge as it slowly reopened.Initially, consumers didn’t respond. In fact, the connection ran the other way: Spending in restaurants tended to predict new virus cases roughly three weeks later, according to Jesse Edgerton, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, citing anonymized data from the bank’s credit-card customers. That suggests restaurants and bars, with their prolonged close contact and loud talking, are potent channels for spreading the disease.Then last week spending dropped, the Chase card data show. The decline is a bit more pronounced in states with faster-growing cases, like Arizona and Florida, but not uniformly so, Mr. Edgerton said. Spending was strong in Mississippi, where cases have grown a lot, but weak in Kentucky, where they haven’t.As Virus Cases Rise, a Florida Restaurant Stays Flexible to Stay OpenJacksonville Beach restaurant owner Don Nicol explains how he is keeping his staff and customers safe from the coronavirus, while also complying with state occupancy regulations, as Florida reached new case records in June. Photo: Don Nicol/TacoLuMs. Markowska was more emphatic: “There’s a clear decoupling in activity between these hot-spot states in the Sunbelt and the Northeast where activity continues to improve. Texas, Arizona and Florida have not just leveled off but are outright contracting. [For them,] what began like a V is morphing into a W.”The economy officially entered recession in February and a recovery may have begun in April. But whether it continues depends, first, on the virus and social distancing, and second, on income growth, which in turn depends on jobs and government stimulus.After collapsing by 22 million in March and April, employment rose, surprisingly, by 2.5 million in May. Economists think it rose by 2.9 million in June, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal. The Labor Department reports the June data on Thursday. Economists’ estimates are unusually wide, ranging from 2 million to 7 million, and the unemployment rate has been harder to predict because of misclassification errors by survey takers.In any case, the jobs data are a snapshot of the second week of June, and since then, hiring appears to have slowed. Data from Homebase, which supplies scheduling software to small businesses, suggests small-business employment rose rapidly from mid-April to mid-June, as businesses reopened, said André Kurmann, an economist at Drexel University who with two co-authors has analyzed the Homebase data.But the recovery, he added, is “now all but stalled: Employment and the proportion of businesses open last week is flat.”In the past week, Florida and Texas have ordered bars to close or stop serving alcohol; Houston issued a stay-at-home order, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered bars and restaurants in 19 counties to close. Those moves alone are probably not enough to derail the recovery.But if case counts keep climbing, states might impose more restrictions, or people will simply stay home. If hiring grinds to a halt in July, that will deprive households of income just when enhanced unemployment-insurance benefits are due to expire.IHS Markit, an economic-analysis firm, sees a 20% chance that a second wave of infections could result in a W-shaped recovery. “Official backtracking on the relaxation of restrictions as well as voluntary pullback on the part of consumers could cause spending to weaken again sharply, throwing the economy back into a brief two-quarter recession,” it said.If the recovery does resemble a reverse square-root symbol, that would likely be in line with most economists’ forecasts. Indeed, it was the most popular prediction of academic economists surveyed by the University of Chicago’s Initiative on Global Markets.Being economists, however, they took pains to use the most abstruse expression available, referring to it as a “reverse radical.”MOREFed Debated Options to Provide More Economic SupportGlobal Manufacturing Shows Fresh Recovery SignsStreetwise: When Companies Prepare for Disaster, Investors Should Expect Lower ReturnsWrite to Greg Ip at greg.ip@wsj.com",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-reverse-square-root-recovery-11593602775
Wall Stree Journal,"MOSCOW—Russians voted overwhelmingly to change their country’s constitution, paving the way for President Vladimir Putin to remain in power and chart Russia’s destiny for years to come.With 50% of polling stations reporting, preliminary results showed that 76% of voters on Wednesday approved the package of some 200 constitutional amendments that include a revision to reset the clock on the current limit of two consecutive presidential terms. That would allow Mr. Putin to potentially run two more times after his current tenure in office expires in 2024, keeping the former KGB boss in the Kremlin until 2036 when he would be 83 years old.Putin’s 20 Years in Charge and What Could Be His Biggest Test YetDuring more than 20 years in power, Vladimir Putin has faced a number of challenges while pushing to expand Russia’s influence. But the coronavirus pandemic might be the biggest test to his leadership yet, as he moves to possibly extend his presidency until 2036. Photo: Getty ImagesThe final official tally of the vote, which stretched over seven days beginning on June 25, is expected by Monday, according to Russia’s Central Election Commission, which reported voter turnout at 65%.Given Mr. Putin’s control over the political scene for more than two decades, analysts said there was little doubt over the outcome of the vote, which underscored Mr. Putin’s grip on all levers of power in Russia and the domineering influence he wields over his people.In ChargeRussian President Vladimir Putin, in power for over 20 years, has recently seen his approval rating slip as living standards stagnate and Russia battles a major coronavirus outbreakMr. Putin's approval rating100%123456775Approve50Disapprove2502000’10’20Dec. 31, 1999Mr. Putin becomes acting President, replacing Boris Yeltsin1May 7, 2000Mr. Putin takes office as President after a March snap election2March 14, 2004Mr. Putin wins second term amid an oil price boom and rising living standards3May 8, 2008Mr. Putin steps aside to serve as Prime Minister4May 7, 2012Mr. Putin is back as President amid mass protests against his rule5March 18, 2014Russia formally annexes Crimea from Ukraine, followed by conflict in Eastern Ukraine and U.S. and European sanctions on Moscow6March 18, 2018Mr. Putin wins his fourth term as President amid declining living standards; protests follow in 2018 and 20197Sources: Levada Center (rating); staff reports“This says that there is extremely weak social resistance to [Putin’s] power,” said Lev Gudkov, director general of the independent pollster Levada Center in Moscow. And while many people might not understand all the legal nuances of the approved amendments “the general meaning is clear enough … that is this is an extension of the presidency, Putin’s lifelong presidency,” Mr. Gudkov added.The new amendments give the president greater sway over courts and prosecutors, and boost the role of the State Council—an advisory body that Mr. Putin already heads—enshrining it in the constitution as a tool of Russia’s executive branch. As head of this empowered agency, Mr. Putin could remain in control and guide policy even after relinquishing the Kremlin following another two six-year terms.Alexander Konotoptsev, 42, said he voted in favor of the changes because he sees stability as the main priority for Russia.PHOTO: ARTHUR BONDAR FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALMr. Putin didn’t comment on the vote, but in recent days he said he had “not ruled out” running for another term if voters approved the constitutional changes. On Tuesday, he urged Russians to cast their ballots for the country in which they want to live and pass on to their children and grandchildren.“Stability, security, well-being and a decent life for our people can only be guaranteed through our development, and we alone can do this by acting together,” he told the nation in a televised address.The package of constitutional changes include a number of measures aimed at easing Russians’ economic pain amid one of the world’s worst outbreaks of coronavirus, which has infected more than 655,000 people nationwide.Still, Mr. Putin’s longevity in office isn’t assured. His popularity, and clout, depend on, among other things, Russia’s economic health, the happiness of its citizens at home and the Kremlin’s ability to assert its influence overseas, Russian political analysts say.Russians have seen consecutive years of falling real disposable income and eroding living standards as the state’s role in the economy has expanded under Mr. Putin and as Russia has faced a wave of international sanctions following the Kremlin’s the annexation of Ukraine Crimean Peninsula and lower prices for the oil and natural gas it exports.Voters participated outside Moscow on Wednesday.PHOTO: ARTHUR BONDAR FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALPolice were out in force guarding Moscow to ensure there weren’t mass protests.PHOTO: ARTHUR BONDAR FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALOver Mr. Putin’s tenure, the state’s expanded control over vital sectors like banking, transportation and energy has increased inefficiencies and hindered development, analysts say without benefiting ordinary Russians for whom the official poverty level increased to 12.3% last year from 10.8% in 2013.According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia’s economy hasn’t grown in dollar terms for a decade. As oil prices remain low and the coronavirus pandemic roils the world economy, the IMF is estimating that Russian gross domestic product will contract by 6.6% this year.“There’s quite a lot of tension associated with the sharp decline in income,” Mr. Gudkov said.Levada says its surveys show a decline in support for Mr. Putin, whose approval rating dropped to 59% in April, down from 82% in April 2018.As such, authorities in some regions pulled out the stops to entice people to the polls, pitching raffles and prizes for those who voted. Several polling stations were decorated with balloons and posters, creating a festive atmosphere, and some voters were given lottery tickets after casting their ballot.RELATED READINGQ&A: What Putin’s Referendum Means for RussiaRussia Vote Could Extend Putin Era for YearsPutin’s Global Ambitions Are Upended by Coronavirus’s Heavy Toll in RussiaMixed in with the political changes in the package before voters were measures aimed at their wallets, such as a guaranteed minimum wage and annual pension adjustments.At a polling station at a school in northern Moscow, municipal workers handed out free meals of beef and buckwheat, a staple crop, to voters.Alexander Konotoptsev, 42 years old, said he voted in favor of the changes because he sees stability as the main priority for Russia.“I don’t want any serious turbulence or shake-ups,” the software engineer said. “If people want Putin to stay on, why not, it’s our decision.”Mr. Putin’s supporters laud the state-driven economy, saying it has promoted Russia’s fiscal stability, predictable monetary policy and stimulus efforts, such as a $400 billion series of infrastructure projects that include new highways and high-speed rail lines.“Guaranteeing pensions, access to health care, the protection of Russian land—these are things that matter for us,” said Vasily Myasnikov, 64, after casting his ballot at a polling station inside Moscow’s Gulag museum, where officials checked voters’ temperatures and handed out masks and gloves. “Putin’s term reset doesn’t matter so much.”Levon Petrosyan, 29, a bank employee, said changing the constitution to allow Mr. Putin to remain in power for a long time to come was undemocratic.PHOTO: ARTHUR BONDAR FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALNot so, said Levon Petrosyan, 29, a bank employee. He said changing the constitution to allow Mr. Putin to remain in power for a long time to come was undemocratic.“I voted no [to the constitutional changes] because I categorically disagree with his policies, which are against democratic freedoms,” Mr. Petrosyan said. “Opposition is repressed and if he stays, no change is possible here.”The prospect of economic stagnation and a further clampdown on civil liberties under Mr. Putin, such as the limiting internet freedoms and stifling opposition, is what troubles German Vorotynsky, the manager of a local business center in Mytishchi, a sleepy commuter town some 15 miles north of Moscow.“We are already going into a totalitarian direction,” said Mr. Vorotynsky, 39. “ As a citizen of Russia, I cannot accept that.”Activists who staged a small protest on Moscow’s Red Square by creating the numerals 2036 with their bodies—the year until which Mr. Putin could retain presidential power—were quickly detained and later released. The action mimicked a protest by activists who in 1991 created an obscene word with their bodies in front of the Kremlin to object to a law on morality which banned swearing in public places. On Pushkin Square, another popular site for protests in Moscow, around 300 people gathered without incident to denounce the constitutional changes. Dozens of people who took similar action on a square in downtown St. Petersburg were promptly disbanded by police.The Moscow group OVD-Info that monitors police detentions reported that around two dozen people were detained in anti-vote protests in various cities across the country. Most of them had been released by Wednesday evening, the group said.German Vorotynsky, 39, the manager of a local business center outside Moscow, voted against the constitutional change, citing economic stagnation and a further clampdown on civil liberties under Mr. Putin.PHOTO: ARTHUR BONDAR FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALOther constitutional amendments adopted by the vote enshrine Russians’ “faith in God,” ban same-sex marriage and ensure the constitution outranks international treaties and legal rulings. That worries some rights advocates who have often sought justice in European courts, but was welcome news to some voters who said it guarantees Russia’s independence.“International rules cannot dictate the direction of our country and what we should believe in,” said Mr. Vasily Reva, 60, a mathematician who voted in Mytishchi.On the foreign policy front, initial domestic applause for Mr. Putin’s muscular stance toward the West, his military interventions in Syria and his Crimea annexation no longer resonates as strongly among citizens and such sentiment would likely refocus Mr. Putin’s priorities inward, analysts said.“Foreign policy is no longer the reliable substitute for dealing with burning social and economic problems at home,” said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a nonprofit think tank in Moscow.Write to Ann M.

Wall Stree Journal,"Factory activity around the world showed further signs of recovery in June as governments eased restrictions designed to contain the coronavirus, but weak demand still weighed on production and employment, according to surveys of purchasing managers.In the U.S. and Germany, manufacturing activity declined at a slower pace, a sign that the global economy is starting to rebound from a deep contraction, according to IHS Markit, a firm that produced many of the surveys. Manufacturing sectors returned to growth in a number of other countries, including France, the U.K., Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia and Ireland.“We certainly have a recovery,” said Patrick Artus, chief economist at French bank Natixis. “In June, the recovery seems to be faster than we expected.”While businesses reported that the lifting of restrictions had made it possible to ease up on layoffs and get supplies or raw materials, they said weak demand from overseas was holding them back.Two surveys released Wednesday showed U.S. manufacturing in June returned to the cusp of growth. IHS Markit said its U.S. purchasing managers index for manufacturing was 49.8 in June, from 39.8 in May. A separate survey by the Institute for Supply Management released Wednesday showed that manufacturing activity expanded slightly in June at 52.6, up from 43.1 in May. New orders posted the strongest monthly gain since records began in January 1948, ISM said.Readings below 50 indicate contraction and readings above 50 indicate expansion.Respondents to the U.S. survey said they saw demand stabilize in June, which made them optimistic about future prospects. And while manufacturers continued to reduce their workforce, the rate of job losses slowed considerably, the firm said.Export orders continued to weaken, however, which respondents said could be due to the fact that some of their overseas markets remain in lockdown.“U.S. manufacturers have reported a marked turnaround in business conditions through the second quarter,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “A record upturn in business sentiment about the year ahead likewise hints that business spending and employment will start to revive.”Mr. Williamson added an uptick in coronavirus cases in some parts of the U.S. could cause demand to weaken again. And around the world, production and sentiment are still below their pre-pandemic levels, which could drag down the recovery, he said.Economists said the manufacturing data should be approached with caution. While they suggest an improvement, they don’t show how much ground has been made up.The surveys show manufacturing conditions are better than they were, said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. “What is neither measured nor apparent from these types of data in such an unusual circumstance is how much better, and what proportion of pre-crisis activity levels have been regained,” he wrote in a note to clients.An early indication of how the sector’s actual output changed won’t be available until July 15, when the Federal Reserve releases its industrial-production measure for June.China is the global economy’s manufacturing powerhouse and was the first major economy to ease its lockdown, having been the first to fall victim to the virus. The June survey of purchasing managers pointed to an acceleration in activity, a path that other countries will hope to follow in coming months.For Kaiterra, an air-quality-tracking-device maker whose manufacturing base is in Shenzhen, China, getting finished products to customers’ doorsteps has been one of the biggest challenges this month after production finally returned to pre-coronavirus levels.What PMI Numbers Won’t Tell YouIn recent years, purchasing managers indexes have become important indicators of where the global economy might be heading. But in the current slowdown, where small businesses were some of the hardest hit, PMI numbers may not be telling the full story. WSJ explains. Photo: Getty Images“We’re spending a lot more of our time on logistics just trying to help people find better [shipping] deals,” said Liam Bates, Kaiterra’s chief executive.Demand for the Switzerland-based company’s devices has skyrocketed this year as a result of the pandemic, which increased some people’s concerns about air quality.The company has turned more to sea shipments after airfreight prices surged and it faced wait times of more than two weeks to get packages on flights.Logistical challenges have also increased the cost of obtaining components. The supply side has been less of a headache, said Mr. Bates, adding that the boost in sales helped the company to offset the higher shipping costs.“What’s unusual about this pandemic is everyone is in the same boat. We all know that something crazy is going on,” said Mr. Bates.NEWSLETTER SIGN-UPReal Time EconomicsThe latest economic news, analysis and data curated weekdays by WSJ's Jeffrey Sparshott.PREVIEWSUBSCRIBEWhile logistical bottlenecks are being cleared, other factories are encountering what is potentially a larger problem: weak demand.“We had no issues at all getting components, but we didn’t get orders from our customers,” said Park Jong-jin, head of the planning team at YoungjinIND Ltd., a semiconductor-equipment manufacturer.The Icheon, South Korea-based company had previously halted production when orders dried up in February and March. The company had to temporarily transfer all its manufacturing staff to take on maintenance and repair roles. Manufacturing restarted in June as new and delayed orders began trickling in.Data releases over recent weeks have pointed to a rebound in consumer spending in a number of large economies, including the U.S. But retailers appear to have met that surge in demand from existing stocks, with little sign of a boost to factory orders.Germany is Europe’s largest manufacturer, and figures released Wednesday by its statistics office showed a 13.9% increase in retail sales between April and May. But the country’s survey of purchasing managers at factories recorded a continued fall in new orders during June.Factories have responded to shrinking order books by laying off workers. Rising unemployment is likely to weaken demand further, threatening a vicious cycle. That suggests governments and central banks are likely to add to their existing stimulus measures to ensure that the recovery proceeds smoothly, and the global economy avoids a double-dip recession.Write to Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.comCorrections & AmplificationsIHS Markit said its U.S. purchasing managers index for manufacturing was 49.8 in June, from 39.8 in May.

Wall Stree Journal,"Major auto makers reported sharp drops in second-quarter U.S. vehicle sales, as sweet discounts and financing deals weren’t enough to offset factory and dealership closures from the Covid-19 pandemic.General Motors Co. GM -0.88% reported a 34% drop in second-quarter sales compared with a year earlier, with demand picking up in May and June. Toyota Motor Corp.’s TM -0.81% sales fell by about one-third, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU 0.25% NV reported a 39% decline.Overall, second-quarter U.S. vehicle sales are projected to have fallen by about one-third, analysts estimate, after car plants and some dealerships closed for extended periods this spring. Most major car companies reported second-quarter sales results Wednesday.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSIf you are shopping for a new car, how do the prices and options compare to previous years? Join the conversation below.Still, the drop wasn’t as steep as feared, and sales have improved steadily since late March. Heavy sales promotions and federal stimulus checksthat went out to millions of Americans this spring spurred car demand despite spiking unemployment and stay-home orders across many states, dealers and analysts say.Now, the industry’s sales rebound faces a tough summer test, as auto makers reign in discounts and the effect of the federal stimulus fades.“I’m not sure what the next six months is going to be,” said Mike Maroone, a former president of AutoNation Inc. who owns dealerships in Colorado and Florida.Related VideoThe Economic Ripple Effect of Retail SalesAnalysts and economists are paying close attention to monthly retail sales numbers as a way to gauge how the economy may be recovering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Photo: Kathy Willens/Associated Press.Auto makers earlier in the spring rushed to offer recession-era discounts and financing deals, which bolstered sales of profit-rich pickup trucks and sped a rebound in retail sales as dealers got better at selling cars online. In recent weeks, retail sales, or sales to individual buyers, have tracked just 4% to 6% below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, according to research firm J.D. Power.“The market and the retail consumer continue to recover beyond anyone’s expectations,” Bob Carter, Toyota’s sales chief for North America, said recently.But now many dealerships are running low on inventory as auto makers ramp up output after several weeks of factory downtime. Deals are drying up as car companies spend less on cash-back offers and pull back on attractive seven-year financing deals that brought customers to dealer lots during the pandemic.Since hitting record highs in early May, company-sponsored discounts have fallen nearly 13%, according to J.D. Power. Promotional loans stretching out seven years accounted for a smaller portion of the market in June, representing 9.4% of transactions last month, compared with 12% in May.Ward’s Intelligence estimates U.S. car dealers in June had 32% fewer vehicles on their lots compared with a year earlier. Pickup-truck supply was down 50%, as demand for trucks outpaced the rest of the market.“The marketplace is growing less inviting,” said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst for car-shopping website Edmunds.com. “Current sales paint an optimistic picture given the circumstances, but between Covid-19 and today’s politically charged climate, the industry needs to prepare for uncertainties ahead.”GM said its fleet business—deliveries to businesses, government buyers and rental companies—suffered, but retail sales fared better, down 24%. The company blamed thin supply after factories closed for nearly two months. Fiat Chrysler cited a drop in fleet sales.Fiat Chrysler’s shares were down 3.7% on Wednesday afternoon, at $9.87. GM’s shares were off about 1%, at $25.03.Nissan Motor Co. ’s second-quarter U.S. sales fell by nearly half, also hurt by a drop in fleet sales. Honda Motor Co. ’s second-quarter sales fell 28%.Hyundai Motor America said sales in June fell 22% after demand from rental-car companies evaporated, but sales to individual retail buyers rose 6%. U.S. sales chief Randy Parker cited extra customer touches for attracting buyers during the pandemic, such as free drop-off of new-vehicle purchases, and a previous promotion that promises to cover six months of payments if buyers lose their jobs related to Covid-19.“We’re adapting to the new norm,” Mr. Parker said.The U.S. auto industry began 2020 with expectations that vehicle sales, while slowing from a peak of 17.6 million in 2016, would remain healthy. After two straight quarters of sales declines, analysts are now predicting sales could fall below 14 million in 2020.Despite the bounceback in retail business since early April, fleet sales, which account for roughly 15% of the U.S. car market, are expected to remain depressed, according to analysts and executives. Industry forecaster ALG Inc. estimates fleet sales fell 68% last month, compared with June 2019.Long the auto industry’s most reliable customers, the rental-car companies have been slow to return to the market as their businesses remain buffeted by the pandemic’s economic fallout.—Ben Foldy contributed to this article.",7/1/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-sales-fell-in-the-second-quarter-despite-deals-and-covid-19-stimulus-11593621053

The U.S. needed 20 months from the low-water mark after the 2009 recession to recover an equivalent share of lost jobs. Economists projected that the hiring surge in May might be a blip, but the Labor Department revised up payrolls by 90,000 for April and May combined.Low-skilled and lower-wage workers suffered the most from the lockdowns, but the good news is they're being hired back. That caused average hourly wages to decline 1.2% but total hours worked increased 3.6%. Unemployment rates declined for whites (to 10.1%), blacks (15.4%), Hispanics (14.5%) and teens (23.2%). Strikingly, the black teen unemployment rate is 10.9 percentage points lower than in June 2016.Nearly all industries added jobs with large rebounds in leisure and hospitality (2.1 million), retail (740,000), health care (358,000) and manufacturing (356,000). Even employment at general merchandise non-department retailers is up 202,000 from last June as big-box stores increased hiring during the pandemic to meet a surge of online shoppers.Some corporations like J.C. Penney, Hertz and 24 Hour Fitness have filed for bankruptcy in recent weeks, though most were overleveraged before the pandemic. J.C. Penney reported this week that it has now reopened nearly all of its stores that were forced to close during the pandemic and revenues are higher than expected.State reopenings and the Federal Reserve bond-market interventions have headed off many more bankruptcies, which would have retarded the nascent recovery. The bad news bears are pointing out that permanent job losers increased by 588,000 in June, and no doubt many of these are a result of small businesses shutting down permanently.According to a Yelp report last week, 139,339 businesses were listed as closed on June 15, down from 176,822 on April 19. But about 41% of the business closures are permanent including 26% of gyms and fitness studios, 35% of retailers and 53% of restaurants. These closures will slow the economic recovery, but far more would have shut if most states hadn’t eased their strict lockdowns in May.States that kept businesses closed longer will also take longer for jobs to recover. During the second week of June, 7.6% of workers in Arizona, 9.9% in Texas and 11.6% in Florida filed for unemployment claims compared to 15.2% in Connecticut, 15.9% in Massachusetts and 17.5% in New York.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been luxuriating in Schadenfreude at the Covid-19 flare-ups in states in the South and West that reopened earlier, but the cause-and-effect is ambiguous. Most businesses across Wisconsin were allowed to reopen May 13 with few restrictions after the state Supreme Court enjoined Gov. Tony Evers’s lockdown orders, but hospitalizations and cases haven’t increased.Many states including Indiana and Rhode Island haven’t had a resurgence after letting businesses reopen. Yet cases have risen in California’s Bay Area and the Seattle region that have remained mostly shut down.Protests probably contributed to the resurgence. The daily new cases per capita in King County, around Seattle, increased five-fold in the month after the protests and county data show the reproductive number has been growing. Hospitals in the Southwest have reported a surge of Americans crossing the border from Mexico for medical care.***Liberals are casting the sunnier than expected jobs report as mostly cloudy. They say next month’s will be worse due to the state flare-ups. Ergo, Congress must extend the $600 weekly federal enhanced jobless benefit that is scheduled to lapse at the end of July. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden want to tie enhanced jobless benefits to a state’s unemployment rate, but this would maintain the incentive not to work in states with already high jobless benefits and retard the national recovery.Most Americans prefer a job to a welfare check. The virus will be around for some time, and states may need to adjust their reopenings in response to flare-ups. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a mandatory mask order on Friday, which beats a shutdown. The more states can do to let Americans safely return to normal life, the better for the economy and overall well-being of the American people.Opinion: You Say You Want a Revolution?Wonder Land: The benchmark for American revolt remains the Declaration of Independence signed on July 4, 1776.

Wall Stree Journal,"New York Police Department officers are pictured as protesters rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Times Square on June 1.PHOTO: MIKE SEGAR/REUTERSFor those wondering where the Defund the Police movement is going, look no further than New York City. On Tuesday the City Council endorsed Mayor Bill de Blasio’s bid to cut $1 billion from the police—roughly 17% of the department’s budget.OPINION: POTOMAC WATCHD.C. Statehood; A Win for School Choicebb0282a3-e4cb-42ba-9988-2f3df57fd912@1.00xCreated with sketchtool.00:001xSUBSCRIBENew York isn’t the only city moving to defund its police, but it bears particular significance as America’s commercial capital. And its funding cuts are especially striking because it comes in a place that implemented the policing revolution that transformed the Big Apple from a crime-ridden metropolis in the early 1990s into what it was in 2014 when Mr. de Blasio was sworn in: America’s safest big city. Thousands of New Yorkers are alive today because of this policing revolution’s success at reducing the murder rate.No doubt the City Council was mindful of the protesters gathered outside their building who clashed with police. Far from being happy with the cut, the protesters complained the $1 billion wasn’t nearly enough. It never is.When Mr. de Blasio first ran for mayor, he campaigned against the police and vowed to end a tactic called stop and frisk. Liberals claimed it wasn’t responsible for the reduction in crime, which they attributed to demographics. In 2013 federal Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that stop and frisk was unconstitutional, and eventually the city abandoned it.Now the antipolicing efforts are accelerating. The City Council has eased the laws against such quality-of-life offenses as vagrancy and public urination, and Manhattan’s district attorney is no longer prosecuting them. Governor Andrew Cuomo’s bail reform this year lets even repeat offenders back on the streets immediately. In recent weeks the police department dismantled its plainclothes anti-crime units under political pressure. The head of the police captains association has called for ending the highly successful CompStat system that tracks crimes across the city and helps police focus on high-crime neighborhoods. The union says it encourages too many police interactions with minorities that result in police being blamed.The result is already more crime. For the first half of 2020, murders in New York City rose 21% over the same period a year ago, shootings are up 46% and shooting victims are up 53%. The victims include a 17-year-old high school basketball star, Brandon Hendricks, who was gunned down Sunday night in the Bronx while attending a barbecue.“You have a criminal justice system that is imploding,” NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea told reporters last week. “Imploding. That’s the kindest way to put it.” The New York Post reports that since the George Floyd protests began police retirements are spiking, with 272 cops choosing to leave the force—compared with 183 over the same period last year. They won’t be replaced as the city’s budget cuts will forgo two of the next four classes of NYPD recruits, reducing the headcount by 1,163 uniformed officers (out of some 36,000).As police retreat from the anti-crime lessons of the last three decades, and even from active policing lest cops be put in the dock, the crime rate in New York will bear close watching. If violence and disorder continue to rise, the fault will lie with the rich liberals who empower criminals and then leave the consequences to be suffered by the most vulnerable.Opinion: Who Wants to Be a Cop?Main Street: Following weeks of protests decrying institutional racism and police brutality, what happens if men and women of character and ability conclude that being a police officer just isn’t worth it?

As they told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “the only thing that kept those mobsters, that crowd, away from us is that we were standing there with guns.”If soaring gun sales are a guide, millions of Americans are with the McCloskeys. This week the FBI announced a record 3.9 million background checks for June, the highest monthly total since the FBI began keeping the statistic in 1998. Adjusting to reflect checks only for gun purchases, the National Shooting Sports Foundation says this works out to 2.2 million, a 136% increase over June 2019. NSSF spokesman Mark Oliva says about 40% of these checks are for first-time gun buyers.This is a warning to the Defund the Police movement about unintended consequences.

Wall Stree Journal,"President Trump’s most prominent Silicon Valley supporter, billionaire Peter Thiel, has told friends and associates that he plans to sit out this year’s presidential campaign because he thinks re-election is increasingly a long shot, people familiar with the matter say.Mr. Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc., spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, where he criticized the state of the economy and described Mr. Trump as a man set to rebuild America. One of the few tech leaders to publicly back Mr. Trump that year, he also donated $1.25 million to the Trump campaign and related groups.In recent weeks, however, in private conversations from his oceanfront estate in Hawaii, Mr. Thiel has said he soured on the president’s prospects, the people said. Mr. Thiel said he believes it is likely that the economy will be mired in deep recession in November, with double-digit unemployment, and that any sitting president would be at a stark disadvantage to a challenger.Mr. Thiel doesn’t currently plan to speak at this year’s Republican convention, scheduled for Aug. 24-27, one of the people said. Though he may eventually still vote for Mr. Trump, Mr. Thiel hasn’t donated any money to Mr. Trump this year and currently doesn’t plan to, the people said.One person who speaks to Mr. Thiel about politics says he described Mr. Trump’s campaign as the “S.S. Minnow,” a reference to the ship that ran aground on the television series “Gilligan’s Island.”Why Biden’s May Fundraising Performance Matters for CampaignPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden outraised President Trump by about $7 million in May, according to their campaigns. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why that’s significant. Photo: APMr. Thiel didn’t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel didn’t comment.Mr. Thiel has been and remains a supporter of the president, said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.Despite his lack of enthusiasm, Mr. Thiel also views the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden as an uninspired choice aligned too closely with traditional liberal beliefs, the people said. Mr. Thiel is unlikely to publicly break with Mr. Trump, as he sees no advantage to doing so, they said.A self-described Libertarian, Mr. Thiel publicly reveled in his iconoclast role as a Trump booster in 2016. He told friends after Mr. Trump’s victory that he was nearly as delighted to have his own prediction proven right as he was to see any of Mr. Trump’s specific policies enacted.Mr. Thiel, 52 years old, famously moved to Los Angeles in the years following, turned off by what he viewed as the comparatively intolerant, left-leaning politics of the San Francisco Bay Area. He donated to Mr. Trump again around the midterm elections in 2018, and as recently as late last year, he enjoyed close ties to the White House; in one instance, he attended a private dinner with the president and Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. Mr. Thiel was an early investor in Facebook and serves on its board.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat do you think about President Trump’s chances for re-election? Join the conversation below.Mr. Thiel’s funding for the Trump campaign in 2016 included a donation that October after a video surfaced in which the candidate bragged of groping women, when some Trump supporters were wavering. Mr. Thiel said the remarks were in poor taste, but not disqualifying. Though he still has time to make a late move again, this year Mr. Thiel instead is likely to spend millions of dollars on races in the House and Senate, in an effort to keep at least one branch of government in Republican hands, people familiar with the matter said.“His biggest concern is that if people vote down the ticket, everything flips in one direction,” said one person familiar with Mr. Thiel’s plans.The Daily Beast earlier reported that Mr. Thiel hadn’t donated to Mr. Trump’s reelection campaign.Some of the investor’s disillusion with Mr. Trump can be traced back to before the coronavirus outbreak was national news. Mr. Thiel was early to note the scientific alarm as the virus leapt across China, Italy and the U.S., and grew frustrated with the pace of Mr. Trump’s response, the people familiar said. Mr. Thiel’s data company, Palantir Technologies Inc., recalled staff from abroad in mid-February, ahead of most other American companies.Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, where he criticized the state of the economy and described Mr. Trump as a man set to rebuild AmericaPHOTO: ANDREW HARRER/BLOOMBERG NEWSWhile Mr. Thiel is willing to cut Mr. Trump some slack over a once-a-century pandemic, Mr. Thiel is withering in his assessment of the president’s reelection campaign, the people familiar say.

Wall Stree Journal,"Workers remove the Christopher Columbus statue in Columbus, Ohio on June 1st.PHOTO: DORAL CHENOWETH/ZUMA PRESSThe city of Columbus, Ohio, this week unceremoniously evicted a 16-foot bronze statue . . . of Christopher Columbus. “For many people in our community, the statue represents patriarchy, oppression and divisiveness,” said Mayor Andrew Ginther, giving the removal order two weeks ago. “That does not represent our great city.”Which great city, precisely? He forgot to mention. Or perhaps the mayor is going to start referring to his town euphemistically as “Ohio’s capital” and so forth, the way some people refuse to say the name of the Washington Redskins football team. This could make campaigning for his re-election rather awkward: Vote Ginther for mayor of [Unmentionable Racist].Don’t laugh, because a petition at change.org has 118,000 signatures—an eighth of Columbus’s population—to rechristen the city Flavortown. That would reflect the region’s status as “one of the nation’s largest test markets for the food industry,” while honoring the enduring legacy of a Columbus native, the celebrity chef Guy Fieri. Alas, the petition’s creator has since apologized. Renaming the city, he says, “should be a fight led by those most affected,” and “as a white male, I don’t have a say in this.”A columnist for the Columbus Dispatch noodled—jokingly?—that because “it’s always dangerous to name something after humans,” how about: Pleistocene, Ohio. Is the unpronounceable symbol once used by the musician Prince available again, or would that be cultural appropriation of Minnesota? A letter to the Dispatch had a bold idea: “Cowed, Ohio.”The statue of Columbus sat in front of Columbus City Hall for 65 years. It was a gift from the people of Genoa, Italy. Now the mayor’s office says it’s “in safekeeping at a secure city facility.” What a blow to U.S.-Italy relations. At least he could offer to give the statue back. A second Columbus likeness, a marble of the navigator pointing west, was booted last month by Columbus State Community College, where it used to stand in the downtown Discovery District.The mayor’s office says the unelected Columbus Art Commission will launch a “participatory process” to find new art that “offers a shared vision for the future.” Good luck. “Let’s just leave the space empty,” one Dispatch letter suggested, “because if not everyone is happy should anyone be happy?” What a sad sign of the times.Opinion: Joe Biden's Statuesque SilenceMain Street: As mobs tear down statues of Lincoln and Grant, where does the Democrat stand?

In addition, Luckin Coffee said 15 more workers faced other disciplinary action and that it would end its business relationship with all third parties involved in the scheme.Luckin Coffee, which has said it is cooperating with related investigations by Chinese and U.S. authorities, previously fired its chief executive and chief operating officer over their alleged roles in the fake sales.

Wall Stree Journal,"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio touted roughly $1 billion in reductions at the nation’s largest police department this week, but skeptics questioned whether those predicted savings will materialize or address what many residents see as excessive policing.As part of a nationwide movement seeking drastic overhauls of local police forces, protesters camped outside City Hall for days calling for sharp cuts in the New York Police Department’s budget. After tough negotiations with the City Council, the mayor said the city’s $88.19 billion budget struck a balance between keeping New Yorkers safe and reducing the reach of the NYPD, which has about 36,000 officers in uniform and 19,000 civilian employees.Advocates of stronger law enforcement said the stance of politicians regarding police will hurt recruitment and morale, and could usher in more crime. But the outcome also dismayed many New Yorkers seeking deeper change. Some said other agencies should be relied on first to handle incidents such as outbursts from the mentally ill, traffic accidents and parade barriers.The city’s public advocate, Jumaane Williams, a Democrat, said city leaders missed an opportunity to debate how to redefine the role of police at a time of intense scrutiny of police conduct and crime prevention nationwide.“The people whose lives are being lost, they deserve for us to have a real conversation, especially in a place that says it’s progressive, like New York City,” Mr. Williams said. He said the budget sends the wrong message by allowing the hiring of more police, but not more teachers, counselors or social workers.The public advocate said he won’t sign the property tax warrants allowing the execution of the city budget. He says the city can’t collect property taxes without his signature, but the mayor says that is a misinterpretation of the law.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, defended the budget as real reform, with new funding for youth centers, recreation programs and broadband access for public housing residents. He said further plans in his next year and a half in office will reflect broader changes for the city and policing, including looking at institutional racism at all agencies.Most residents “appreciate that our police are there to keep us safe and they want to see policing get fairer, more respectful,” the mayor said. “They believe in the NYPD, they want to see the NYPD improve in some ways.”Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said the reductions will present a ‘significant challenge’ but won’t cripple the department.PHOTO: JASON SZENES/SHUTTERSTOCKThe city allotted about $5.2 billion to the NYPD in the 2021 fiscal year, which began Wednesday, down from about $6.1 billion for the prior year, according to the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget.City Council members and other analysts have disputed the mayor’s assertion of $1 billion in cuts to police. They said that claim counted on unrealistic expectations for reducing overtime by $352 million, or roughly half the sum spent in recent years.In announcing savings, the mayor also touted a gradual move to transfer School Safety Agents from the police department’s control to the Department of Education. The school system has sent the NYPD more than $300 million yearly to pay for those safety officers through an intracity funding agreement. Several council members said transferring the agents didn’t reflect a meaningful change in city spending or reduce the presence of uniformed officers in schools.Canceling the July class of 1,163 police recruits saves $55 million in salaries, according to budget documents. The mayor also counted as police cuts the elimination of their fringe benefits, as well as benefits for safety agents and school crossing guards, who will be moved outside the NYPD. But those benefits are covered by a citywide pot of funds, not the NYPD, and so shouldn’t be counted as police reductions, council members said.Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat who voted against the budget, said reductions amounted to about $120 million in cuts to the police department’s operating expenses.“A cut of a billion dollars would have been a down payment on a longer-term process of transforming public safety,” he said. “I don’t think what we did even rises to the level of down payment. If you don’t even impose a hiring freeze, how can you say you were taking seriously the need to reduce policing?”Thirty-two council members voted for the budget and 17 against. Those who voted no were divided on whether there were too many cuts to the police budget, or too few. The budget also cut $450 million in NYPD capital funding.The deal came after more than a month of large-scale protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. His death in May set off rallies demanding police reform and a shift in money from local police departments to social services, education and help for young people.The positions of the mayor and the City Council on reducing the police force will backfire by hurting morale and recruiting, said Eugene O’Donnell, a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Mr. O’Donnell said that the NYPD should be streamlined but that the budget process didn’t tackle those problems. “It isn’t motivated by efficiency or effectiveness,” he said. “It was designed to flog and humiliate the police.”Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said in a televised interview with Fox5’s “Good Day New York” on Wednesday that the reductions will present a “significant challenge” but won’t cripple the department.“You’re seeing the City Council bow to mob rule,” Mr. Shea said. “Let’s mark the date on the calendar on how long it’s going to be before we’re having a conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police.”New York City ranked among the highest spenders on police per resident in fiscal 2020, according to a study of 72 big cities nationwide by the Vera Institute of Justice, which advocates for less spending on policing and more on communities.The study said New York City spent $626 per resident on police, behind Baltimore and Newark, N.J., but more than Boston or Chicago.New York City had more police per resident than most cities, the study said, with one police department employee for every 162 residents, compared with one for 308 residents in Los Angeles and 346 residents in Dallas, for example.Councilman Stephen Levin, a Brooklyn Democrat who voted for the budget, said the spending shifts marked just the beginning.“Changing police culture doesn’t happen with any one budget cut,” Mr. Levin said. “What will make a difference is changing the culture, having the ability to fire cops that have histories of abuse, redefining what is a police officer’s job and scaling that back significantly.”Write to Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com and Katie Honan at Katie.Honan@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/de-blasio-faces-calls-for-deeper-nypd-change-after-1-billion-budget-shift-11593730477
Wall Stree Journal,"Facebook Inc. leaders including Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are set to meet early next week with civil rights groups that called for an advertising boycott against the company over its handling of hate speech and misinformation.Among the top requests from the groups will be for Facebook to hire an executive with civil rights expertise for a post in the social-media giant’s C-suite.NEWSLETTER SIGN-UPCMO TodayCMO Today delivers the most important news of the day for media and marketing professionals.CONTENT FROM OUR SPONSORDeloitteCMO Insights and Analysis from DeloitteLive Sporting Events: The New No-Contact SportDuring the pandemic, sports fans expect a safe and contactless experience at the stadium, enabled by technology.

Facebook, which has been under growing pressure to change and update some of its content and brand-safety policies, this week requested a new meeting with civil rights leaders, including Mr. Greenblatt, Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, and Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP.Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change.PHOTO: BILL CLARK/ZUMA PRESS“We share the goal of these organizations; we don’t benefit from hate and we don’t want it on our platforms,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. “We look forward to hearing directly from these organizations and sharing an update on the investments we’ve made and the work we’re continuing to do.”The civil rights leaders want Facebook to make meaningful changes and be more accountable at the top echelons of its leadership structure. Facebook executives, such as Joel Kaplan, the company’s vice president of global public policy, play a role in content decisions. But they have a conflict of interest because they also are looking to curry favor with politicians who may have their own opinions about content on Facebook, said Mr. Robinson.“There needs to be a separation between content security and safety, and the people who lobby with politicians,” Mr. Robinson said.Facebook’s work in this area includes embedding civil rights expertise on teams across policy and product, the company said.The ad boycott is just one of many pressures confronting Facebook, which also has been under fire from many employees, activists and Democrats who say it has failed to enforce its rules against politicians, including President Donald Trump. Several employees have disagreed publicly with Facebook’s stances on a variety of issues, including its recent decision to leave up a post by Mr. Trump that many academics and employees say violated the company’s rules about inciting violence.Some employees say some of these missteps stem from the lack of diversity at the top of the company. Thursday, a Black Facebook employee and two job candidates filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission saying Facebook is biased against Black employees and makes it more difficult for them to get hired and promoted. Among other issues, the employee said he heard the N-word said at work.“We believe it is essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment. We take any allegations of discrimination seriously and investigate every case,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement.The civil-rights groups have listed 10 steps they would like Facebook to take, and say each one is important. But Mr. Greenblatt said another priority among them is for regular, outside audits of identity-based hate speech and misinformation on the company’s platforms, with the results made available publicly.Whether Facebook will agree to any of the groups’ specific recommendations is far from certain. Facebook executives, including Carolyn Everson, vice president of its Global Business Group, previously told advertisers that the company wouldn’t change its policies based on revenue pressure.Mr. Greenblatt said the boycott wasn’t about making a dent in Facebook’s ad revenue, which totaled $69.7 billion last year, mostly from small and medium-size companies. The goal is to get the company’s attention and encourage change, he said.Interactive: Facebook Faces an Advertiser Boycott. Will Its Business Take a Hit?STEPHANIE STAMMAdvertisers that have paused spending on Facebook and Instagram include Unilever PLC, Clorox Co., Starbucks Corp., Ford Motor Co., Microsoft Corp., Coca-Cola Co., Levi Strauss & Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. But not every one of them is a member of the boycott campaign, and may have different priorities.Some of the boycott organizers’ recommendations speak more directly to advertising concerns, including broadening Facebook’s brand-safety tools and providing more refunds when ads appear next to objectionable content.Facebook issues refunds when ads run in videos and some other content formats that violate its policies, but the policy doesn’t include ads that run next to Facebook’s main news feed, according to a person familiar with the matter.Other steps requested of Facebook by the boycott organizers include the creation of an internal system to automatically flag hateful content in private groups for human review, and the finding and removing of public and private groups focused on white supremacy, violent conspiracies, vaccine misinformation and other objectionable content.Facebook addressed some of the groups’ requests in a blog post on Wednesday, describing some of the steps it has taken and its plans for countering hate speech and misinformation, as well as for ensuring a safer environment for advertisers. The company said it already generates reports on suspected hate speech and funnels them to reviewers with training in identity-based hate policies in 50 markets and 30 languages.It also said it is exploring ways to make users who moderate groups on Facebook more accountable for the content in those groups.On Tuesday, Facebook also classified a large segment of the boogaloo movement as a dangerous organization and banned it from its network for “actively promoting violence against civilians, law enforcement and government officials and institutions.”MOREFacebook’s Latest Error Shakes Advertisers’ Confidence November 25, 2020Salesforce Puts Money Into AppsFlyer November 24, 2020Bruin Sports Capital-Backed Two Circles Buys Sponsorship Firm TRM Partners November 16, 2020Civil rights leaders said they had notified Facebook earlier about the presence of this movement on its platforms.“Facebook had a knowledge of the growing boogaloo presence on their site and they did nothing about it,” said Mr. Johnson of the NAACP. “What must happen is a change in their algorithm so those white supremacists and hate groups are not directed at their targeted audiences.”Facebook said it has removed boogaloo content when it has identified a clear call for violence, including pulling more than 800 posts in the last two months.Earlier this week, Facebook announced it would include the prevalence of hate speech as a data point in its Community Standards Enforcement Report, through which the platform shares updates on its progress combating content that violates its policies. The reports are assembled and issued by Facebook, which said it would now release those reports quarterly.Mr. Zuckerberg previously said Facebook would look to open its content moderation systems for external audit.

Wall Stree Journal,"An antimalarial drug helped reduce deaths in hospitalized patients infected with Covid-19, according to a large retrospective study published Thursday.Coronavirus patients treated with the drug hydroxychloroquine within the first two days of admission were more likely to survive than patients who received other treatment, according to the study, which was published online by the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.The study, which analyzed medical records of 2,541 Covid-19 patients, suggests that hydroxychloroquine can be effective if given during the early stages of contracting the virus and at the right dose, the researchers said. Other studies, however, haven’t found a benefit, and federal health officials withdrew the drug’s authorization for emergency use.Patients whose records were analyzed were given 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine twice on the first day, followed by 200 mg twice a day the following four days.“We gave it early,” said Marcus Zervos, head of the infectious-diseases division for Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who co-authored the study. “If it’s given late in therapy, it’s going to have relatively more limited benefits.”Researchers sometimes do studies based on analyses of medical records, but trials that test patients randomly assigned to get an experimental drug or placebo are considered the gold standard of drug trials.Dr. Zervos said prospective, randomized studies are needed to further confirm the study’s results. Such studies are under way in the U.S. and other countries.Patients who received the antimalarial drug followed Covid-19 treatment guidelines put in place in March by the hospital, Dr. Zervos said. None of the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had serious heart conditions, he said.Earlier this year, hospitals and doctors world-wide began treating Covid-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, and a similar drug, chloroquine, after several small studies suggested a benefit. Both drugs were approved decades ago to treat and prevent malaria but have also been used for other ailments, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.Several studies since then, however, have raised questions about the efficacy of the drugs against Covid-19.Last month, the National Institutes of Health halted its clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine, concluding the drug was very unlikely to help hospitalized patients. The Food and Drug Administration also revoked its emergency-use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of the Covid-19 disease after concluding they are unlikely to help fight the disease.In the peer-reviewed study published Thursday, about 13% of the patients who received hydroxychloroquine died, compared with 26% patients who didn’t receive the medication. About half the patients analyzed were male, half were Black and about half were younger than 65 years old.Researchers analyzed medical records of patients admitted to the six-hospital health system from March 10 to May 2, who received the drug within the first two days of being hospitalized. More than 80% of the patients got the drug within 24 hours of admission.The peer-reviewed study, which was funded by the health system, also found that those treated with the antibiotic azithromycin alone or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin also fared slightly better than those not treated with the drugs. Some doctors in the U.S. have incorporated the antibiotic into treatment regiments.Dr. Zervos noted that in a recent study in the U.K. which was halted after researchers said there was no benefit from hydroxychloroquine, the drug was administered at higher doses.Write to Jared S.

Wall Stree Journal,"Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and longtime confidante of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, was arrested Thursday morning in a quiet New Hampshire town and charged with facilitating Mr. Epstein’s alleged sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls.The arrest of Ms. Maxwell, nearly a year to the day after Mr. Epstein’s on related charges, marks the latest chapter in a lurid legal drama that for years has trailed Mr. Epstein and his associates. After Mr. Epstein’s death in custody last summer forced the government to end its prosecution of him, federal prosecutors now have another opportunity to lay bare what they describe as a yearslong sex-trafficking ring.An indictment unsealed Thursday in Manhattan federal court alleges Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein groomed and abused victims as young as 14 years old. Ms. Maxwell, 58 years old, faces six counts, including perjury, transportation of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity, and conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts.A lawyer for Ms. Maxwell couldn’t be reached to comment.Ms. Maxwell’s uncertain whereabouts had been the subject of speculation since Mr. Epstein was arrested a year ago on sex-trafficking charges, and officials on Thursday painted a picture of a socialite on the lam. Prosecutors said Ms. Maxwell, the daughter of the late media baron Robert Maxwell, appeared to have been living on a 156-acre property in Bradford, N.H., that she bought in an all-cash purchase in December under a limited liability company.The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office, which brought the charges, asked a federal court to detain Ms. Maxwell, saying she “poses an extreme risk of flight.”In a court hearing conducted over the phone Thursday afternoon, a federal magistrate judge in New Hampshire ordered Ms. Maxwell over to the custody of U.S. Marshals, who will take her to Manhattan.Prosecutors said Mr. Epstein worked with others to create a pipeline of young girls for sexual activities. Ms. Maxwell has been accused by multiple women in affidavits and court filings of recruiting young women for Mr. Epstein and training them for sex.While Mr. Epstein had been charged with the abuse of young girls between 2002 and 2005, the indictment against Ms. Maxwell spans 1994 and 1997.“This case is the prequel to the earlier case that we brought against Jeffrey Epstein,” acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said at a press conference Thursday.Ms. Maxwell played a “critical role” in finding and grooming victims, and sometimes participated in the sexual abuse, Ms. Strauss said.The indictment unsealed Thursday details some of those methods, including attempting to befriend them and taking them shopping with Mr. Epstein. After developing a rapport with a victim, prosecutors allege, Ms. Maxwell would “try to normalize sexual abuse” by discussing sexual topics and undressing in front of the victim.Ms. Maxwell was also allegedly present during the victims’ interactions and sex acts with Mr. Epstein; sometimes she encouraged the minor victims to give Mr. Epstein massages, the indictment alleges.The perjury counts stem from statements Ms. Maxwell made in 2016 depositions in connection with a civil case in Manhattan federal court, related to Mr. Epstein. In those depositions, she denied knowing about underage girls at Mr. Epstein’s properties and said she didn’t recall if Mr. Epstein kept sex toys at his Palm Beach home.“She compounded her crimes by repeatedly lying in 2016, when she was questioned under oath,” Ms. Strauss said Thursday. “Maxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable.”Mr. Epstein’s arrest last July on sex-trafficking charges brought renewed attention to the role Ms. Maxwell allegedly played at his side, initially as his girlfriend, then as his property manager and aide. The charges also raised questions about the sources of Mr. Epstein’s wealth and his relationships and social dealings with politicians and business leaders, including former President Clinton, President Trump, Britain’s Prince Andrew, Bill Gates, law professor Alan Dershowitz and Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley.READ MOREEpstein’s Death Sparks Probe, Shifts Spotlight to Associates (Aug. 11, 2019)Jeffrey Epstein Burrowed Into the Lives of the Rich and Made a Fortune (July 25, 2019)Following Epstein’s Arrest, Spotlight Shifts to Financier’s Longtime Associate (July 11, 2019)While Mr. Epstein was in custody, a New York appeals court ordered unsealed dozens of documents in a civil lawsuit related to Ms. Maxwell, making public for the first time some of the details of the alleged abuse, which included a vast web of people who allegedly recruited and facilitated a sex-trafficking ring. Mr. Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell the next day.The trove of documents was filed as part of a defamation suit brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre against Ms. Maxwell, whom Ms. Giuffre, now 36, has alleged took part in Mr. Epstein’s yearslong sexual abuse of her as a teenager. The suit was settled in 2017, but litigation continues over efforts to have materials from the suit unsealed.“Their whole entire lives revolved around sex,” Ms. Giuffre said of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell in a deposition. “They call massages sex. They call modeling sex.”Another woman, Johanna Sjoberg, testified in a deposition that Ms. Maxwell recruited her in 2001 while she was a college student to answer phones for Mr. Epstein. After one day, Ms. Sjoberg was instructed by Mr. Epstein’s associates on how to give Mr. Epstein a naked massage that involved sexual acts, she said.Although the Manhattan federal judge overseeing Mr. Epstein’s child sex-trafficking case dismissed it, his accusers have called for his associates, including Ms. Maxwell, to be held responsible for allegedly enabling abuse.David Boies, a lawyer who is representing Ms. Giuffre and other women who have accused Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, said he and his clients were “really pleased” by Ms. Maxwell’s arrest.“It would have been a miscarriage of justice if this had simply ended with Epstein’s death,” Mr. Boies said.Bill Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s New York field office, said the FBI and the New York Police Department had been “discreetly” keeping tabs on Ms. Maxwell over the past year, and learned she had “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire” where she “continued to live a life of privilege.”In their detention memo Thursday, prosecutors said Ms. Maxwell is a naturalized U.S. citizen but retains citizenship in the U.K. and France and appears to possess passports from the three countries. In the past three years, she has taken multiple international flights, prosecutors said, including to Japan, Qatar and the U.K.Prosecutors also said she had “significant financial resources,” citing more than 15 bank accounts associated with her name, with balances ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $20 million. Prosecutors also cited millions of dollars transferred between Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein between 2007 and 2011.Ms. Maxwell was arrested without incident, Mr. Sweeney said.The investigation, authorities said, remains ongoing.U.S. prosecutors have asked U.K. authorities in recent months for help securing testimony from Prince Andrew, an associate of Mr. Epstein who has been implicated by Ms. Giuffre in the alleged sex-trafficking ring.—Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Davis O’Brien at Rebecca.OBrien@wsj.com and Deanna Paul at deanna.paul@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ghislaine-maxwell-confidante-of-jeffrey-epstein-arrested-on-federal-charges-11593697302
Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—Rep. Liz Cheney is walking the Republican Party’s finest line.The third-ranking GOP lawmaker in the House has regularly broken with President Trump over his foreign policy and national security decisions—while sidestepping any bruising personal fights with him. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, the Wyoming congresswoman has backed medical experts and urged people to wear masks, a step Mr. Trump and many Republican allies were reluctant to embrace.Ms. Cheney has also balanced her criticisms of Mr. Trump with vigorous attacks on their shared opponents, including congressional Democrats and the Chinese government. Unlike those pressing Mr. Trump to deploy a more diplomatic tone, Ms. Cheney has at times used similarly combative rhetoric.“How about you stop eating bats. Seriously,” Ms. Cheney said on Twitter in response to a mid-March tweet from the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman defending China’s efforts to share virus information. Scientists generally believe the coronavirus originated in the animal world, likely in bats, then jumped to a so far unknown intermediate host animal before infecting humans.Ms. Cheney has also skewered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif) and criticized the high-profile quartet of liberal House Democrats known as “the squad.”With national polls showing Mr. Trump sliding ahead of November’s election, many Republicans see Ms. Cheney—a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney—emerging as a figure poised to help redefine the GOP when Mr. Trump is no longer leading it.“If you’re trying to rebuild the team postelection, having a strong woman with conservative credentials from flyover country is a pretty strong platform,” said former Senate GOP aide Stewart Verdery.Ms. Cheney, taking a pen from President Trump after he signed a bill in April, defies him on some issues but in a respectful manner.PHOTO: ANNA MONEYMAKER/POOL/SHUTTERSTOCKIf Mr. Trump wins re-election in November, “I’m not sure there’s a place in House Republican leadership” for someone willing to regularly break with him, said Democratic strategist Bridgett Frey. But if Mr. Trump loses, Ms. Cheney’s independent profile “is a huge asset for them,” particularly if the GOP needs to win back white female voters, as recent polls suggest.Ms. Cheney declined to comment. Mr. Trump has praised Ms. Cheney in the past, saying she has a “pretty unlimited future.”A senior administration official said Mr. Trump recognizes that Ms. Cheney votes with him the vast majority of the time, but that on foreign policy she, like her father, wants the U.S. to be engaged in more military conflicts than the president does.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat do you think Liz Cheney’s political future looks like? Join the conversation below.Ms. Cheney, 53 years old and a mother of five, was elected to Wyoming’s sole House seat in 2016 after working at the State Department and on the presidential campaign of George W. Bush. She has spent the past four years carving out a role as a defense hawk willing to challenge Mr. Trump’s efforts to whittle U.S. involvement in conflicts overseas.She criticized Mr. Trump’s moves to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and his recent decision to cut the current U.S. troop presence in Germany in half. She was one of the first Republicans to raise alarms over reports that Russia had paid bounties to insurgents to have American forces killed in Afghanistan.But unlike other GOP lawmakers who have criticized Mr. Trump, Ms. Cheney has never become the public target of the president’s wrath. Mr. Trump feuded bitterly with former Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and recently Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whom Mr. Trump pledged to campaign against in 2022.“She doesn’t make it personal,” said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.).When Mr. Trump first announced his plans to withdraw troops from Syria, for example, Ms. Cheney and a small group of House Republicans, including military veterans, requested a meeting with him, said Rep. Richard Hudson (R., N.C.).Ms. Cheney, speaking at a news conference in December, has taken a different approach on the pandemic than Mr. Trump, urging caution early on.PHOTO: ALEX WONG/GETTY IMAGESMs. Cheney began by thanking Mr. Trump for backing increases in military spending and “projecting strength abroad, but then she talked very honestly about her concerns,” said Mr. Hudson, who attended the meeting in the Oval Office. “Liz didn’t pull any punches, but she did it in a respectful way.”Ms. Cheney has also taken a different approach on the pandemic than Mr. Trump, urging caution early on. In early March, before national shutdowns began, she skipped the retreat of top House GOP leaders in St. Michaels, Md., over safety concerns.In April, when Mr. Trump, eager to restart the economy, said the federal government had total control over whether states reopen closed businesses, she pushed back on Twitter. “The federal government does not have absolute power,” she wrote.In May, she called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert and a target of conservatives, “one of the finest public servants we have ever had.” And last Friday, she tweeted a picture of her father wearing a cowboy hat and a blue surgical mask, below the hashtag “realmenwearmasks,” echoing the saying popularized by Mrs. Pelosi urging Mr. Trump to set an example.Ms. Cheney’s approach has at times left her out of step with some conservatives. On Tuesday’s conference call meeting of the House GOP, calls that are organized by Ms. Cheney, Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) said he thought Republicans should be meeting in person now, his spokesman confirmed. Ms. Cheney’s leadership office sent out an email to House Republicans on Wednesday saying it was working on organizing an in-person meeting the week of July 20.Some House Republicans haven’t appreciated the frequent appearances on those calls of Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, who has painted a more dire picture  than some Republicans feel is warranted, according to GOP aides.“I didn’t agree with everything that got said,” on the call, said Rep. Ted Yoho (R., Fla.), who said Republicans should avoid being alarmist about the virus. “We need to allay the fears of the American people.”One area where Ms. Cheney lags behind other senior Republicans is in fundraising.PHOTO: TOM BRENNER/REUTERSMs. Cheney is frequently described as all-business and unpretentious by GOP lawmakers and aides. GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne said he made reservations at a nice restaurant in Birmingham, Ala., when Ms. Cheney and her father came to campaign for his Senate run last November. But the Cheneys had a different idea.“What she and her dad preferred was to go to a not-so-nice restaurant at the hotel we were staying at and have popcorn,” for dinner, Mr. Byrne said.Ms. Cheney’s decision to stay in the House, rather than run for retiring Sen. Mike Enzi’s seat this fall, led many Republicans to predict she will be the first female GOP House speaker.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) is among Mr. Trump’s closest allies in the House. Major GOP losses in November could pave the way for a leadership shake-up that vaults Ms. Cheney higher. But many Republicans believe she is playing a longer-term game, positioning to be Mr. McCarthy’s successor or a top cabinet official under a future GOP president.Republicans who spoke with her about her decision to stay in the House said she was influenced by her father, who spent a decade in the House, including in the same role she holds as conference chair.One area where she lags behind other senior Republicans is in fundraising, typically a prerequisite for winning the secret-ballot elections that determine House leadership roles.Through the end of May, her leadership political-action committee had raised about $360,000, up from the $132,000 she raised in the 2018 cycle, her first term in the House. By contrast, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) had raised about $1.7 million through the end of May, comparable to his 2018 haul, and Mr. McCarthy had raised more than $4 million through the end of May and $4.2 million in the 2018 cycle.Ms. Cheney has done close to 100 events across the country for House GOP colleagues and candidates this cycle, a GOP aide said.—Julie Bykowicz and Michael C.

Wall Stree Journal,"A vandalized memorial to President Andrew Jackson near the White House, June 23.PHOTO: KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERSPeople have said for decades that America needs to have “an honest conversation about race.” Is this what they had in mind—this drama of marches, riots, witness videos, tear-gassings, surging police lines, Trump tweets, Zoom pressers, statue-topplings, Facebook screeds, cable television rants, window-smashings, shop-burnings, police-defundings, escalating murder rates and the distant thunder of editorial boards?Veterans in the field of less-than-revolutionary race relations learned that a certain amount of truth-suppression is actually helpful—preferable to the “honesty” of hatred, for example. Much progress has been accomplished under cover of hypocrisy—or, if you like, civility. Good manners and artful hypocrisy were Booker T. Washington’s game, but he was written off as an Uncle Tom long ago.We live now in the regime and culture of confrontation—ideology as performance, anger as proof of authenticity. You remember how much trouble Joe Biden got into when he bragged about his ability to get along with segregationists in the 1970s. Mr. Biden was preening thoughtlessly on his skill in the arts of the old hypocrisy. Now he has learned his lesson and embraces the left’s idea of honesty—no deviation from the party line or from the officially approved emotions.How do you judge a moment of history when you are in the thick of it? How can you tell if all of this will be remembered as historic or will be superseded and forgotten as another momentary sensation, another self-important mirage? The current moment feels intensely historic now, but we shall see.Black Lives Matter has ambitions to abolish its own version of the Chinese Cultural Revolution’s “Four Olds”—old customs, old culture, old habits, old ideas—and to add a fifth, old statues. Yet this summer the titanic racial theme competes and fuses with other superstories—the pandemic and its economic consequences, the presidential race, America’s long-running politico-religious civil war.Raw emotion pours out of social media and into the streets—outrage, with a touch of holiday. On the other side is an oddly silent majority. It seems eerie that so much of the country—the land of “white supremacy,” as the left likes to think of it—gives the appearance of having almost acquiesced, as if it has conceded that the eruptions might be justified and even overdue. Can it be that the silenced majority has had an epiphany, that in its heart it acknowledges the justice of black Americans calling in Thomas Jefferson’s IOU, “I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, and that his justice cannot sleep forever”?There’s some of that—changed minds, old prejudice grown reflective. In any case, the silenced majority, out of moral courtesy, has been reluctant to criticize people demonstrating in the wake of George Floyd’s killing. At the same time, it recoils—more indignantly and incredulously each day—from the left’s overall program and mind-set, which it considers insidious if not crazy. When major cities propose to cut off funds for their police departments or to abolish them altogether, that Swiftian absurdity makes a deep impression, confirming a broader doubt about the left’s intentions and mental health.The most tragic impediment to an honest conversation about race in America is fear—an entirely realistic fear of being slain by the cancel culture. This fear to speak is a civic catastrophe and an affront to the Constitution. It induces silent rage in the silenced. It is impossible to exaggerate the corrupting effect that the terror of being called a “racist”—even a whiff of the toxin, the slightest hint, the ghost of an imputation—has on freedom of discussion and the honest workings of the American public mind.Racism in America is no longer totalitarian, as it once was, especially in the South. The cancel culture is the new totalitarianism, a compound of McCarthyism, the Inquisition, the Cultural Revolution, the Taliban and what has become a lethal and systemic ignorance of history—almost a hatred of it. All that wild, unearned certainty, all that year-zero zealotry, discredits those who associate themselves with the cause and makes a mockery of their sweet intentions. Much of the white woke rage is radiant with mere self-importance.And it’s going to backfire. Newton’s Third Law of Motion hasn’t been repealed: For every action there is still an equal and opposite reaction. My sense is that there is quietly building a powerful backlash, which will express itself on Nov. 3, if not before. My guess is that polls now showing Mr. Biden far ahead don’t reflect reality. It may be impossible for President Trump to win; for some reason, he collaborates daily with his enemies to sabotage his chances. But the outcome is by no means as certain as the polls now suggest.Mr. Morrow is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.Opinion: America’s New NihilismWonder Land: ""Systemic racism"" is a systemic forgetting of 55 years of urban policy failure.

Wall Stree Journal,"A statue of Confederate naval commander Matthew Fontaine Maury stands in Richmond, Va., Aug. 23, 2017PHOTO: CHIP SOMODEVILLA/GETTY IMAGESMatthew Fontaine Maury isn’t a household name, but an active naval vessel and a building at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., are named for him. That should change.Maury (1806-73) was 19 when he joined the Navy. For years he navigated the globe, studying the ocean and learning about wind patterns. He became one of the founders of oceanography.He made his mark on the country in another way. At the outset of the Civil War, Maury returned home to Virginia. He resigned his commission, choosing treason, secession and slavery over his oath to the Constitution. While fighting for the Confederacy, Maury designed naval mines that sank Union ships. Nothing in the U.S. military should honor his name.I’m a proud graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. As an F-18 fighter pilot, I flew more than 30 combat missions in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I know from experience how the military can transform lives and teach leadership.That’s why it’s time for the military to rename bases, buildings, vessels and anything else that honors those who fought for the Confederacy. Their support for slavery was wrong—and calamitous for the country. Some 618,000 Americans died in the Civil War, nearly as many as have perished in the nation’s other wars combined.Some claim that stripping the rebels’ honors is erasing history. I respectfully disagree. I believe Americans must study history and learn from it; service members are encouraged to read history on their own time, and veterans like me maintain the habit. But studying history doesn’t require honoring Confederate figures.Likewise, you can celebrate towering leaders from the past for their contributions to America—such as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln—while drawing a firm line against honoring those who fought to destroy America.The work of reckoning with the Confederate past is too important to be left to the mob. Vandalism is an affront to the rule of law. Renaming buildings and removing statues must be done in an orderly fashion through legitimate channels. American society is built on laws. Adherence to the law is the only thing that separates any society from barbarism.This is also why the calls to defund or abolish police departments are outrageous. My stepfather, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department, put his life on the line for every family in our community. The sacrifices of law enforcement officers and their families too often go unnoticed.An overwhelming majority of Americans agree that law enforcement needs reform and that abusive officers should be held accountable. But slashing the police budget defies logic and invites disaster.America’s true heroes are those who fight to preserve order, deliver us from evil and ensure all Americans are treated equally. Pro-slavery secessionists who split the nation in two and killed so many of their countrymen don’t deserve such honors.Let’s agree on new American heroes to honor.

Wall Stree Journal,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill, May 12.PHOTO: GRAEME JENNINGS/BLOOMBERG NEWSThe White House will soon begin negotiating with congressional Democrats on a “Phase 4” economic revival plan. President Trump has repeatedly expressed his support for suspending the payroll tax through the end of the year as a way to stimulate jobs and help low- and middle-income families gain after-tax income. Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposes the idea. Instead, she’s pushing the $3 trillion spending bill that passed the House in May, which includes a six-month extension of the $600-a-week supplemental unemployment payments enacted in March, which are scheduled to end July 31.These proposals create opposite economic incentives. The payroll tax suspension would reward employees for returning to their jobs and working more hours by providing a 7.5% rise in take home-pay immediately on income up to $137,700. (Income over this amount would still be taxed at the usual rate, which is lower.) The suspension of the additional 7.5% tax on employers’ wage and salary costs would encourage small businesses to hire more employees by reducing the cost.The unemployment-benefit extension would discourage work. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would pay 5 out of 6 workers more to stay unemployed than to return to their previous jobs. Already employers are having trouble persuading employees to come back.In a study released this week by the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, we estimate, based on employment sensitivity to higher wages, that the full suspension of the payroll tax through the rest of the year would increase employment by about 2.7 million jobs. This would stimulate the economy, increasing gross domestic product in the fourth quarter by 1.2% over what it otherwise would be.Low-income Americans would disproportionately benefit from this policy because they pay a larger share of their income in payroll taxes. A University of Pennsylvania Wharton School study estimates a gain of after-tax income to the lowest-income workers at 7.2% to 10.7%, as employers pass on part of their tax savings in higher pay.By contrast, we estimate the Pelosi plan would eliminate 10 million jobs and increase the unemployment rate by 6 to 8 points (after adjusting for misclassification errors). That would depress GDP for the rest of the year by roughly 5%. Our estimate is lower than those of some other researchers—for example, a Heritage Foundation study that put job losses at 13.9 million.These are economic model estimates and are admittedly imprecise. But these two competing economic approaches were tested in practice during the financial crisis a decade ago. Britain implemented temporary tax cut of 2% of income from 2008 through the end of 2010. In the U.S. President Obama signed into law the 2009 Recovery Act, or “stimulus,” which increased cash benefits, health insurance and food stamps for the unemployed.The U.K. jobs recovery began earlier, and by the end of 2014 the employment rate exceeded precrisis levels. In the U.S., with higher benefits for not working, unemployment stayed very high for several years and the recovery was one of the most anemic in modern times. Mr. Obama did cut the payroll tax temporarily by 2% of income, but the effects of higher marginal tax rates from other Obama policies, especially ObamaCare mandates, canceled out any positive effect.The major argument against suspending the payroll tax is that it helps only those who already have a job. This ignores that many jobless people live in a household with somebody employed. The payroll tax cut is designed to get millions of unemployed Americans into the job market and earning paychecks, which stimulates both the supply of and the demand for goods and services.The difference between Mr. Trump’s and Mrs. Pelosi’s approaches is a swing of almost 13 million jobs—more than the entire workforces of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio combined. If the goal of a Phase 4 stimulus plan is to encourage economic growth and put Americans back to work, the wise choice is the payroll tax cut. It isn’t even a close call.Mr. Mulligan is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and author of “You’re Hired!” Mr. Moore is a co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity and a member of President Trump’s Economic Recovery Task Force.Opinion: Pelosi's $1 Trillion Election GambitWonder Land: Nancy Pelosi offers not a bailout but a bail-in, a nationalization of blue-state spending.

Its author, Francis Scott Key, owned slaves, and the poem’s third stanza includes the cryptic couplet “No refuge could save the hireling and slave / From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave.” I suspect Key was applying the phrase “hireling and slave” to a single entity, the British mercenary soldier, but the professionally outraged aren’t interested in a discussion of poetic meaning.Let me state for the record that I favor keeping the national anthem, especially now that virtue-signaling busybodies want it demoted. But the anthem’s lines—I think we can admit this and remain good patriots—are a little stilted. And the tune, written by the British church organist John Stafford Smith, is notoriously hard to sing. It works well when sung by a high-spirited crowd, but for some reason we insist on having soloists sing it before public events. Most of these soloists’ renditions are cringe-makingly terrible, schmaltzed up with bad rubato and under-the-note singing. You have to stand there, mouth closed and feigning reverence, hoping the soloist’s voice doesn’t crack on the word “free.”We might feel more affection for our national anthem if we were all allowed to sing it together. But few Americans sing together anymore. Bar songs are no more. A few know their school fight songs, but these are good for only one purpose and are generally preposterous. Almost the only people who still sing together are the religious.The Christian tradition to which I’ve belonged most of my life—the Reformed tradition of Protestantism—is not famous for its contributions to the western musical canon. But it is famous for its hymns and hymn-singing. The Lutherans have Bach; the Catholics have Monteverdi and Mozart and many others; the Reformed have . . . Louis Bourgeois. He compiled and composed hundreds of fine hymn tunes in Geneva during the 1540s, including “Old 100th,” to which many Protestant congregations sing the “doxology.” The great majority of the Anglophone world’s best hymns have emerged from the Reformed tradition—either from Presbyterianism or the evangelical side of Anglicanism. While the rest of 18th-century Europe was awash in ideas of the Enlightenment, the Reformed in Britain, Ireland and North America wrote hymns. The hymns of Isaac Watts and John Newton, John and Charles Wesley, and William Cowper are models of poetic efficiency: fresh ideas, evocative phrasing, natural rhymes. From Watts’s “O God Our Help in Ages Past”: “Time, like an ever-rolling stream, / Bears all its sons away; / They fly, forgotten as a dream / Dies at the opening day.” The 19th century produced many other gifted hymn writers associated with the Reformed wing of Protestantism, foremost among them Reginald Heber, Cecil Frances Alexander and Frances Ridley Havergal. Their lines were set to traditional melodies or new tunes by church organists. Alexander’s hymn “Once in Royal David’s City,” for instance—now sung as a Christmas carol—is usually set to the delightful tune “Irby,” composed by the otherwise forgotten Victorian organist Henry J. Gauntlett. The Reformed take hymns seriously. They argue about the matching of texts with tunes and debate the merits of 20th- and 21st-century hymns. The musically astute among them complain about their coreligionists’ inability to sing certain lines properly, and the theologically fastidious remonstrate against some popular hymns’ suspect declarations. A retired Presbyterian minister I know dislikes John H. Sammis’s hymn “Trust and Obey” because it contains the lines “Not a doubt or a fear, / not a sigh or a tear, / Can abide while we trust and obey,” which my friend regards as flatly untrue. The Reformed argue about hymns—but they do sing. Many sing loudly, although in some cases one wishes they wouldn’t. Occasionally I’ve attended services in other traditions and been appalled to find half the congregants barely mumbling the hymns and the other half silent.That’s a missed opportunity. There is something mysteriously fortifying about the act of singing together. Oral and chest cavities vibrating in rhythmic unison—which is all corporate singing is—creates a peculiar companionship among people who, apart from their creed, may have little else in common. You might barely know the lady in the pew next to you, but when you sing a common song or hymn together, she may as well be your auntie. It is one of the great tragedies of modern Western life that people so infrequently sing together. We may sing in the car or the shower, but mostly we listen to soloists gurgle the nonsense lines of pop songs. Somehow, with the rise of radio and recorded songs in the last century, we stopped singing together. Unlike many other forms of decline, this one stands a chance of reversal. Once we’re permitted to remove our masks and gather for a ballgame, we can sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” as the national hymn it is.

Wall Stree Journal,"A server wears a protective mask at a restaurant in West Bloomfield Township, Mich., June 8.PHOTO: EMILY ELCONIN/BLOOMBERG NEWSThere once was a restaurant in central Ohio called the Maramor. It has been gone for decades, but for almost 50 years it did all it could to make its guests happy. There was a slogan on promotional items it gave its diners: “Stay at home for weeks on end, the Maramor remains my friend.”Running a local restaurant can be a tough business. And now, as restaurants across the U.S. start to reopen, proprietors are hoping the old Maramor line comes true: that the customers who have been stuck at home for months will prove to have remained their friends.That smile on the faces of restaurant owners when you walk through the door—customers see it as welcoming and warm, but there is something brave about it, too. Especially at small hometown operations, it’s as if the owners have to prepare for a party every night without knowing if the invited guests will show up. The flowers on the tables, the place settings arranged just so, and each evening there is no guarantee who will come.Customers can be fickle under any circumstances, and now—when, in many states, restaurants’ seating capacity has been reduced by government edict—it will be more dicey than ever to meet expenses, never mind turn a profit. In some cities, looting and arson where restaurants once thrived have dealt an added setback. Uncertainties about Covid-19 further complicate the picture.Each sundown, people at home will make a snap decision—“Want to go out and get some dinner?”—and after months of being told to keep a wary distance from others, they are likely to be tentative. The prospect of being served food by employees in masks and gloves, however commendable the reason, may sound less than sprightly.It’s no one’s fault. But if the premise that the customer is always right can be hard to swallow in regular times, accepting the notion that the absent customer is right—that people may take some time getting used to dining out again—could make maintaining that front-door smile even more daunting.The guests—such a weighted word—at local restaurants seldom see the worry lines. I was on the road once, eating at the bar of an almost empty steakhouse. There was a table set up for 20 people. The fellow who owned the place stood next to it, waiting. And waiting.Finally he went to the phone and made a call. I remember the expression on his face. He joined me at the bar and said the table had been reserved for a prom group. He had confirmed the booking the day before.And the group simply hadn’t shown up. This was the difference between making his numbers that night and taking a loss. During our conversation he brightened only once. A couple had walked in, wanting a bite to eat. He rose and put that restaurateur’s smile on. No need for them to know his troubles.There’s going to be a lot of that in the months to come, all across the country. “Stay at home for weeks on end . . .” The flowers will be freshly cut, the silverware laid out, poised for the possible arrival of long-lost friends.Mr. Greene’s books include “Chevrolet Summers, Dairy Queen Nights.”Opinion: The Coming Urban ExodusWonder Land: After months of the pandemic, protests and failing progressive leadership, many are going to move out of U.S. centers.

Wall Stree Journal,"Business-casual retailers are trying to figure out how to entice Americans who have grown used to T-shirts, leggings and gym shorts to buy their blazers, maxi dresses and fancier pants.Brands like Ann Taylor, Banana Republic and Express have organized online categories around working or staying at home, hoping to keep selling their signature work apparel during the pandemic. But the coronavirus lockdowns have only furthered America’s embrace of informal attire, retail executives say.“We’ve been seeing a shift to more casual wardrobes for decades, quite honestly, in America,” Express Inc. EXPR -0.63% Chief Executive Timothy Baxter said on the company’s earnings call last month. “And I think there is no doubt that this pandemic has pushed that forward even more significantly and even more rapidly.”SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat’s your work-from-home wardrobe?

The work-from-home category lists blazers and trendy ankle pants, along with casual tees, sweaters and scented candles. Mr. Baxter said the company “saw strength in casual categories such as leggings and jogger pants, driven partly by our new work-from-home and essential shops.”Ashley Goldsmith, a San Francisco-based content strategist for Facebook Inc., bought more casual items to wear during the pandemic, including workout pants, leggings and two robes. While she shopped for comfort wear, she said she noticed the attempts by sellers to push dressier options.“I get it and I don’t blame them for doing it,” Ms. Goldsmith said. “They probably have to do a little bit more convincing” to sell a stylish top to someone who doesn’t need to be lured into wearing sweatpants, she said.A Banana Republic store in Manhattan remained shut in mid-June because of the state’s coronavirus lockdown.PHOTO: MARK LENNIHAN/ASSOCIATED PRESSGap Inc.’s GPS 0.69% sales fell 43% in the latest quarter, weighed down in part by its Banana Republic brand, which is more oriented toward business attire. The brand’s sales fell 47%, compared with an 8% drop for Gap’s athleisure-wear brand Athleta.“In this crisis, with the unforeseen shift to consumers working from home, Banana Republic was disadvantaged in its product mix as customers opted for casual style,” Gap Chief Executive Sonia Syngal said on the company’s earnings call. The brand’s workwear category underperformed in the quarter, she said, while it was lacking inventory of more-casual items.Gap’s research has found that nearly a third of Banana Republic customers are dressing businesslike up top, a spokeswoman said in an email. Banana Republic’s men’s polos category has been trending along with women’s accessories, such as jewelry “for those looking for a little ‘sparkle’ for a virtual meeting,” the spokeswoman said.“If I want to feel more productive, I’ll put on some of the new stuff.”— Massachusetts resident Madeleine FishCapri Holdings Ltd.

Revenue at Jimmy Choo fell 23% in the latest quarter.“We’re going to have to move a little faster on our casual initiatives” for the brand, Mr. Idol said.BJ Bueno, founder of retail consultant Cult Branding Co., said companies can excite consumers about a product but generally they won’t buy it if they don’t need it. Now, for example, a company selling beautiful suitcases is out of luck because people aren’t traveling.“You could offer it, but you’re just not going to move it,” he said.Not everyone, however, is buying for today.

She bought a maxi skirt, some patterned shorts and accessories, plus a new pair of joggers from Athleta.“If I want to feel more productive, I’ll put on some of the new stuff,” she said.Mr. Baxter, Express’s CEO, said the company was at a disadvantage because the company compared with its peers is stronger in more-formal clothing, but said he doesn’t think fancy-clothing occasions “are gone for good.” Sales in the first quarter fell by 53%.“The long-term impact on the way consumers will dress is still to be understood and written,” he said. “I think we’re still evolving.”The Economic Ripple Effect of Retail SalesAnalysts and economists are paying close attention to monthly retail sales numbers as a way to gauge how the economy may be recovering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans are grappling with the mixed signals of a reviving U.S. economy and a resurgent coronavirus caseload as their window for evaluating the need for another round of stimulus legislation is closing.GOP lawmakers have for weeks paused work on another bill, electing to wait until after the July 4 recess to see how the economy recovers and decide what is necessary. But the twin developments Thursday of the U.S. setting a single-day record for new coronavirus cases and the Labor Department reporting that the U.S. economy added 4.8 million jobs in June has muddied the outlook for Senate Republicans.“It’s a little confusing for people because you’ve got a higher rate of covid in the last few weeks and better job numbers than anybody expected,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), who cautioned that the employment picture could deteriorate if the virus continues to spread.When the Senate returns to Washington on July 20, it will have just a matter of weeks to negotiate and pass a new bill before expanded unemployment insurance benefits expire on July 31 and the Senate begins another scheduled recess on Aug. 7. Democrats have urged Congress to pass another bill, approving a $3.5 trillion bill in the House, which included another round of payments.Republicans rejected that bill, but they remain divided how much money to spend in another package—and what to spend it on.“There’s a lot of discussion internally about that and there isn’t any consensus yet,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas).President Trump, who cheered the drop in the unemployment rate to 11.1% in June from 13.3% in May, has said he supports another round of stimulus checks to individuals, but hasn’t offered details.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the administration will “seriously consider” additional direct payments.People lined up in Frankfort, Ky., for assistance with unemployment claims. The unemployment rate dropped to 11.1% in June from 13.3% in May.PHOTO: BRYAN WOOLSTON/REUTERSMany American households received stimulus checks of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child under a bill signed into law in March.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Thursday that Congress should pass another bill to support the economy, which entered a recession in February.“I think we need more now more than ever to keep the momentum. I want to pour on the gas, right?,” Mr. Graham said.But many other Republicans on Capitol Hill see the new employment numbers—which some economists caution don’t capture the impact of coronavirus spikes and some business re-closures at the end of June—as evidence against the need for major new spending. Several GOP lawmakers said they didn’t yet support the president’s push for another round of checks to individuals.“If it turns out the economy is recovering, that’s a good thing, and direct stimulus checks may not be necessary. And so I think we’re still kind of collating, understanding the data as it comes out,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.).Democrats say they are concerned Republicans will play down the economic crisis as a way to justify not spending significantly on stimulus.“I’m very worried, just like the president declared the Covid-19 pandemic over months ago, that Republicans will prematurely declare the economic harm being done as having passed. That is just not true,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.).Republicans are rallying around a desire to take steps to allow schools to reopen this fall and bolster health-care measures like testing to combat the virus, which is spreading among many young people in the country’s south and west. The party has also emphasized protecting businesses from lawsuits related to the virus, a measure that Democrats have criticized.One of the most difficult questions facing Republicans in the next bill is how to address the expiring unemployment benefits. The $2.2 trillion Cares Act passed this spring added $600 a week to the jobless benefits that states offer, in many cases making the government benefit larger than a worker’s pay. Some Republican lawmakers have pushed to end the $600 benefit entirely.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said this week that Congress should provide adequate unemployment insurance.“Unemployment is extremely important. And we need to make sure for those who are not able to recover their jobs, unemployment is adequate,” Mr. McConnell said. “That is a different issue from whether we ought to pay people a bonus not to go back to work. So I think that was a mistake.”Before negotiations begin in earnest with Democrats, who control the House, Republicans said they would need to reach agreement among themselves on what they want to include in another bill.“I think the key right now is to get the White House and Republicans on the Hill in the same place,” said Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. He said negotiations at the end of the month could go down to the wire.“It will be challenging for sure. But in the end if we need to move and we need to act we will,” he said.Additional economic data released over the first half of July will also shape how Republicans act. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said Thursday’s job report is likely an incomplete picture of what the economy looks like.“So it is great news and we should cheer it and be happy for Americans that are going back to work, but we shouldn’t expect that this is going to be a smooth ride. There’s going to be a lot of stops and starts here,” he said.Write to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com and Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/jobs-data-coronavirus-cases-cloud-stimulus-plans-for-senate-republicans-11593727437
Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s coronavirus response plan would expand the federal government’s role in managing the pandemic, renewing a debate about the proper balance of responsibilities between local, state and federal officials in responding to public health emergencies.In a plan released this week, Mr. Biden outlined a robust response from Washington, including the hiring of 100,000 contact tracers, additional mandates on the production of needed equipment, the creation of new federal entities to oversee the distribution of supplies and manage testing, as well as additional economic support for Americans.In addition, if elected president, Mr. Biden would seek to use his executive authority to require masks for public interstate travel, such as transit by air or train, his campaign said. He would also encourage state and local officials to require masks in public places—wading into a culture war battle that has emerged over the role of face coverings in controlling the outbreak.The plan presents a contrast with President Trump’s approach to the pandemic, which has largely allowed states to set their own responses, with the federal government providing some funds and equipment. Mr. Trump has sometimes played down the severity of the virus and didn’t encourage people to wear masks until this week.The program announced this week wasn’t the first time Mr. Biden has laid out measures he would take to address the pandemic but it was far more detailed than his earlier comments.Historically, states have taken the lead in enforcing quarantines and mandating public health measures. Legal experts say the federal government has significant public health and emergency authority of its own but historically has mainly played the role of providing leadership, funding, resources and scientific advice, while leaving the states to administrate and implement their own emergency responses.Mr. Biden’s proposal would increase the direct federal role in matters like contact tracing and regulation of behavior and “could dictate and change the scope of public health interventions for the next century,” said James Hodge, a law professor at Arizona State University, who also serves as director at the university’s Center for Public Health Law and Policy.“What Biden proposes is more of a federalization of these types of response efforts—and that would change the face of public health in the United States on these types of emerging events quite extensively,” said Mr. Hodge. “If we federalize it, it does require strong federal leadership to pull it off. And a lot of Americans are very leery of that facet, especially when you implicate civil liberties.”Historically, states have taken the lead in enforcing quarantines. Here, people walk along the pier at Huntington Beach, Calif. on Wednesday.PHOTO: MIKE BLAKE/REUTERSCourts have repeatedly affirmed that state governments have extensive powers to manage public health emergencies—including the power to quarantine and isolate infected individuals, as well as mandate public health measures like vaccinations. The federal government can also isolate and quarantine individuals, as well as prevent entry to infected individuals into the U.S. and prevent transmission between states.In addition, the federal government maintains significant powers over interstate commerce—with the ability to write laws or issue regulations on the movement of goods and people across state lines. Mr. Biden’s campaign said the former vice president would use that authority to mandate mask-wearing in certain circumstances.There are limits to its power, however. The federal government can’t force state governments to enforce its policies, for instance, a doctrine known as “anti-commandeering.”The federal government has the power of the purse—with resources dwarfing even the largest state governments. A Biden administration could use the threat of putting conditions or restrictions on federal funding as leverage to force recalcitrant states to pursue its policies, though that would be a measure of last resort, said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who has followed the proposals.President Trump’s willingness to leave much of the handling of the pandemic to the states has resulted in a patchwork of responses, with many Democratic-led states adopting stricter public-health measures than GOP-led ones, some of whose leaders have worried more about the impact on the economy and jobs. Some of the places that had begun to open up have seen a new surge of coronavirus infections.In a press conference on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House didn’t regret pushing some states to reopen their economies, even as coronavirus cases reached new highs this week.“I think we’ve had a very careful plan working with the states—this is primarily the states’ responsibility,” Mr. Mnuchin told reporters.The result has been major regional differences in the timing, severity and scope of the outbreak, with many state governments complaining about the allocation of resources by Washington as well the lack of leadership from the Trump administration.The Federal Emergency Management Agency was put in charge of coordinating the response from mid-March onward—weeks late, some critics in emergency management say. FEMA’s subsequent approach has also been critiqued for months.Medical companies received no guidance from the federal government in the first months of the pandemic when they tried to deliver protective equipment such as masks and gowns for health-care workers, according to a memo from the Democratic-led House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which said it interviewed company officials. The companies also warned of a continuing shortage of protective gear, despite months of efforts working with the administration, according to the memo.Nursing homes have complained that equipment sent by FEMA is unusable and in some cases not up to their safety standards, The Wall Street Journal reported.Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who has researched FEMA, said the agency already has the powers to coordinate a response and move supplies to states.But, she said, FEMA is currently lacking effective leadership and a coherent strategy, from the president who appointed the heads of FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security, which houses the agency, on down.“It’s not rocket science but it does require someone who knows something about the government” to properly set FEMA in march, she said.FEMA has defended its efforts throughout the pandemic. An agency spokeswoman said the president “has provided FEMA with the necessary resources” to properly respond with “an unprecedented level of coordination.”—Sabrina Saddiqui contributed to this article.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Rachael Levy at rachael.levy@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-proposes-national-coordination-for-coronavirus-response-11593727017
Wall Stree Journal,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN 1.13% and Sanofi SA SNY 1.85% said their arthritis drug Kevzara failed to help Covid-19 patients recover in a U.S. clinical trial.The failure clouds a class of drugs being studied as potential treatments for Covid-19 patients who experience an abnormal immune response known as “cytokine storm,” which researchers and doctors suspect contributes to the deaths of some patients.The U.S. study of Kevzara was stopped after the drug was shown to be no better than placebo in helping the recovery of critically-ill hospitalized patients, the companies said on Thursday. Patients were considered critical if they were on ventilators, high-flow oxygen or requiring treatment in an intensive care unit.Among patients on ventilators, 80% of Kevzara patients experienced side effects, compared with 77% of patients receiving placebo, the companies said.Detailed results from the study will be submitted for publication in a scientific journal, the companies added.Despite the end of the U.S. study, a Sanofi-led study of Kevzara outside the U.S. will continue on the recommendation of a data monitoring committee overseeing both trials, the companies said. That study is evaluating a different dosing regimen. Results are expected in the third quarter of this year.In April, Regeneron halted part of the U.S. Kevzara study in hospitalized patients who weren’t sick enough to be put on ventilators or receive high-flow oxygen therapy, but received other oxygen support.Kevzara blocks a cytokine protein known as interleukin-6, or IL-6, which plays a role in triggering the body’s immune and inflammatory response. Regeneron and Sanofi started clinical trials of the drug earlier this year after a small Chinese study of another IL-6 blocker, Actemra, showed encouraging results.Genentech, a unit of Roche Holding AG, RHHBY 1.04% is conducting multiple studies of Actemra, including in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc.’s GILD 0.89% antiviral treatment remdesivir.

Wall Stree Journal,"Uber Technologies Inc. UBER -0.16% needs a win.After a failed bid for Grubhub Inc., GRUB 0.49% the ride-hailing giant is trying to buy much smaller food-delivery company Postmates Inc. as it seeks surer footing in the era of Covid-19.The San Francisco-based company needs to get stronger in the competitive world of food delivery as the pandemic has crushed its rides business and surging infections have subsumed early hopes for an economic recovery and people returning to offices.The food-delivery industry was ripe for consolidation even before the pandemic hit, as the biggest companies turned their sights toward making profits on the heels of fast and expensive growth and amid increasingly overlapping markets. As consumers stayed home to stop the spread of the virus, food-delivery became a lifeline for restaurants battered by lockdowns and a relative area of activity in a deteriorating economy.“Uber’s back is against the wall to do a deal in food delivery given the consolidation phase has kicked off,” said Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. “They’re at the prom looking for a dance partner and there’s really only one in the room: It’s Postmates.”SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSHas your use of Uber for ride-sharing or food delivery changed during the pandemic? Join the conversation below.Mr. Ives estimates that Uber Eats could save itself seven to 10 years of trying to grow its business with a Postmates acquisition.In May, Uber cut roughly a quarter of its workforce and Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the company planned to trim $1 billion in fixed costs after stay-at-home orders to halt the spread of the coronavirus ravaged the company’s core business. Rides, which accounted for three-quarters of Uber’s revenue before the pandemic, plunged as much as 80% in April. Last month Mr. Khosrowshahi said that had improved somewhat to a 70% decline.He said in May that Uber Eats, the company’s delivery arm, was a bright spot. In the first quarter, Eats gross bookings surged 52% from the year-earlier period to $4.68 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, expect the category’s second-quarter gross bookings to jump 65% from last year to $5.6 billion.Shares of the ride-hailing giant soared after reports this week that it’s in talks to acquire San Francisco-based Postmates for $2.6 billion, as investors bet a tie-up would allow the company to find savings amid the costly work of building out a delivery operation. When news emerged June 10 that Grubhub had spurned Uber for another suitor, Uber’s shares had one of their worst days of the year, underscoring the importance of some kind of deal.The ride-hailing giant’s shares have recovered from lows hit in March as Uber cut jobs and costs and made clear efforts to reposition itself amid the pandemic, but they haven’t returned to levels preceding news of GrubHub’s sale.Food delivery is an expensive undertaking, and companies have offered steep discounts to get consumers to try out their services. Morgan Stanley projects that Eats will lose $340 million next year globally.Uber didn’t respond to a request for comment.A deal would boost the ride-hailing company’s food footprint in Los Angeles and Phoenix, where Postmates has 35% and 19% of those markets, respectively, according to research firm Second Measure.Brian Nowak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates U.S. food-delivery sales will grow to about $45 billion this year from $31 billion in 2019. Mr. Nowak raised his estimate for 2020 based on an expected shift to online ordering amid shelter-at-home orders. He sees the industry growing to $86 billion in sales in 2025.With about 23% of the U.S. market, Uber Eats slightly edged out Grubhub in meal delivery sales in May, to be ranked No. 2 behind DoorDash’s 45%, according to Second Measure. Postmates had 8% of the U.S. sales that month, the most recent full-month data available from the researcher.Uber’s attempt to acquire Grubhub fell apart in June, in part because of regulatory concerns that it would create a monopoly in New York City. Instead, Grubhub turned to Dutch food-delivery giant Just Eat Takeaway.com in a deal valued at $7 billion.After that, Postmates, the smallest among the major U.S. players, was seen as the next likely target for Uber. Should a deal come together, it could be announced next week if not sooner, according to a person familiar with the matter. There’s no guarantee a deal will be reached and Postmates, which has held discussions with other possible buyers since at least last year, has been simultaneously planning an initial public offering.When Uber reported results for the first quarter in May, Mr. Khosrowshahi said that along with growth in food delivery, he was encouraged by early signs from markets that were beginning to open back up.But a return to normal is unlikely soon, as a recent surge in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations in states such as Florida, Texas and California force or extend shutdown measures indefinitely.California’s turn from bright spot to hot spot is especially troublesome for Uber, as two of its largest markets—Los Angeles and San Francisco—are located in the state. Those cities along with New York City, Chicago and London made up almost a quarter of the company’s gross ride bookings last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, expect Uber’s ride-hailing gross bookings to decline 62% in the second quarter compared with the first three months of the year.Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday rolled back some reopening plans as cases explode across America’s most populous state.

Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court agreed Thursday to decide whether federal courts can hear claims stemming from atrocities committed overseas, including the looting of Jewish property during the Holocaust by German and Hungarian authorities and the exploitation of enslaved children from Mali in cultivating cocoa for multinational food processors.Federal appeals courts hearing separate lawsuits authorized the victims and their heirs to pursue the claims in the U.S., causing Germany, Hungary and the food processors, backed by the Trump administration, to appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that federal statutes and international-law principles forbid U.S. courts from hearing the claims.The German case stems from 1935, when Nazi leader Hermann Göring allegedly forced a consortium of Jewish art dealers in Frankfurt to sell a trove of Prussian religious artifacts for a fraction of its value. Most of the art dealers fled Germany; one who remained soon died. In November 1935, Göring reportedly presented the collection, known as the Welfenschatz or Guelph Treasure, to Hitler as a gift. Heirs of the art dealers, including several U.S. citizens, sued to recover the property, currently held by a museum in Berlin.A detail from a 12th century dome reliquary of the Guelph Treasure.PHOTO: SEAN GALLUP/GETTY IMAGESThe heirs applied for restitution in Germany, but a panel set up to review such claims said it found no evidence the sale was forced. “The lack of demand and the lower purchase price in comparison with earlier estimates can be attributed to the world economic crisis and not to the repression of Jewish art dealers by the National Socialist government,” the panel said. The heirs then filed suit in federal court. “The Nazis viewed the Welfenschatz as an Aryan treasure, and they were disgusted that it was held by Jews,” the plaintiffs’ brief says.In general, foreign governments can’t be sued in U.S. courts, but Congress has made several exceptions, including for state sponsors of terrorism and acts of expropriation that violate international law. Germany argues, among other points, that international law doesn’t prohibit foreign governments from expropriating property of their own nationals. Since the Jewish victims lived in Germany—although Jews were stripped of German citizenship by the 1935 Nuremberg laws—it argues that it cannot be sued in the U.S.In a separate suit, 14 Hungarian Jews who survived the Holocaust, including four who now are American citizens, sued Hungary and its state-owned railway, MAV, to recover property confiscated from Jews who were shipped to death camps.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also approved the suit against Germany, found Hungary’s actions fell under the legal definition of genocide and therefore the suit could proceed in the U.S.Artifacts of the Guelph Treasure in Berlin.PHOTO: SEAN GALLUP/GETTY IMAGES“In 1944 alone, a concentrated   campaign   by   the   Hungarian   government marched nearly half a million Jews into Hungarian railroad stations, stripped them of all their personal property and possessions, forced them onto trains, and transported them to death camps like Auschwitz, where 90% of them were murdered upon arrival,” the opinion, by Judge Patricia Millett, observed.Both Germany and Hungary suggest that the U.S.’s own history is far from unblemished, and that permitting Holocaust victims to sue in federal court could someday lead to foreign courts holding the American government to account.“In the United States today, there is a live and vigorous debate whether our government should pay reparations to the descendants of slaves. But we all assume that [the U.S.] government will make the decision,” Hungary’s lawyers argue. “It is for the legislatures and courts of the United States and the several states to decide how best to reckon with unjust government policies carried out on U.S. soil in past generations,” not overseas courts.Separate cases allege that multinational food companies including Cargill Inc. and Nestlé SA violated international law by aiding and abetting the use of slave labor to cultivate cocoa in Ivory Coast.According to the suit, children between the ages of 12 and 14 were trafficked from Mali to Ivory Coast, where they were forced to work up to 14 hours daily, six days a week. “They were not paid for their work and were given only scraps of food to eat,” the plaintiffs’ lawyers say, “were   beaten   with whips and tree branches when the guards felt that they were not working quickly enough.”Raw cocoa beans being harvested at an Ivory Coast farm in 2015.PHOTO: LEGNAN KOULA/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCYThe companies say they oppose exploitation of children, didn’t own the farms where the abuses allegedly occurred and aren’t responsible for mistreatment. But the issue before the court is whether a centuries-old law known as the Alien Tort Claims Act allows the victims to pursue the suit at all.Enacted in 1789, it authorizes lawsuits in federal court by “an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” It lay largely dormant until the 1970s, when human-rights lawyers invoked it to file claims for war crimes and other atrocities committed overseas. The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit permitted proceedings to continue under the alien tort statute.The Supreme Court, however, has come to view such claims skeptically, and recent rulings have sharply cut back the scope of suits that can be filed, blocking liability for foreign companies and for acts with little or no connection to the U.S.The corporations argue that the Ivoirian cases should be dismissed under those precedents.Otherwise, claims could be filed “against any U.S.-headquartered company that does business in a foreign nation where human rights violations allegedly occur,” said the brief for Minneapolis-based Cargill. “As long as the complaint contained general allegations of oversight from the U.S. headquarters and visits to the country by employees from headquarters,” lawsuits could still proceed, the brief said.The cases—Germany v. Philipp, Hungary v. Simon, Cargill Inc. v. Doe and Nestlé USA v. Doe—are expected to be heard in the Supreme Court term beginning in October and decided by July 2021.Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-to-decide-federal-courts-authority-over-claims-from-overseas-atrocities-11593717050
Wall Stree Journal,"Hugh Downs, an omnipresence of 20th-century American television who once held the record for most hours logged on-air, died Wednesday at his home in Scottsdale, Ariz.He was 99 and died of a heart ailment, according to a family spokeswoman.During a career lasting more than 50 years, Mr. Downs held myriad positions including news anchor, game-show host and late-night television sidekick. His good looks and calm demeanor made him a comforting presence.Mr. Downs is probably best known for his time as an anchor of NBC’s morning show “Today” from 1962 to 1971. He also anchored the long-running ABC News magazine program “20/20” from 1978 until his retirement in 1999. For most of that run, his co-anchor was another news legend—Barbara Walters. He also hosted the game show “Concentration” from 1958 to 1969.“Anything I would do that would allow me to do more broadcasting or get more money or more attention, I would do so,” Mr. Downs said of his willingness to take on so many different jobs in an interview with the Television Academy. Mr. Downs spent more than 15,000 hours on camera, which was a record until Regis Philbin surpassed that mark in 2004.Hugh Downs and Barbara Walters are shown during the March 17, 2003, taping of ‘ABC's 50th Anniversary Celebration’ in Hollywood.PHOTO: FRED PROUSER/REUTERSMr. Downs’s ability to stay cool under pressure was never more visible than on Feb. 11, 1960, when “The Tonight Show” host Jack Paar walked off in the middle of the broadcast, leaving Mr. Downs to take over in front of a stunned studio audience and millions of viewers at home.Mr. Paar was angry at the network’s censors for removing a joke from the previous night’s show. He ranted about it on-air with Mr. Downs and then announced he was leaving the show. “I don’t need it,” Mr. Paar said, and then he departed to a standing ovation.Mr. Downs said to viewers that he told Jack he wished he wouldn’t do this and that he does things “hastily” sometimes.“God knows I’d like to be any place but here right now,” Mr. Downs told viewers. He then went on to host the show from his sidekick’s chair. Mr. Paar did return on March 7, famously opening with, “as I was saying…”When Mr. Paar did finally leave the show for good in 1962, Mr. Downs thought he might be tapped to replace him as host. Instead NBC went with Johnny Carson and offered Mr. Downs the “Today” gig.“I never was a showbiz-type personality,” Mr. Downs said in an interview with the TV Academy.Hugh Downs hosts the ‘Today’ show on NBC, March 10, 1966.PHOTO: JACK KANTHAL/ASSOCIATED PRESSHugh Malcolm Downs was born Feb. 14, 1921, in Akron, Ohio. His father was a salesman. The family moved to Lima, Ohio, when he was 2. His father later rented a small farm near Lima, where the family raised chickens. Young Hugh attended a two-room schoolhouse, whose curriculum was heavy on the Bible and the novels of Zane Grey.After graduating from high school, he attended what is now Bluffton University in Ohio, but dropped out after a year. Prodded by his father, he struggled to find work in 1939. While on an errand to pick up a jug of milk, he impulsively walked into a radio station in Lima and, despite a lack of experience, told the receptionist he wanted to become an announcer. After an audition, he got a part-time job that soon led to full-time work as a program director.He moved on to radio jobs in Detroit and Chicago before moving into television, a medium that he initially saw as “a gimmick, like 3-D movies, that would go away,” he told the TV Academy.In New York, he landed a job as an announcer and recurring guest on Sid Caesar’s “Caesar’s Hour,” which is where Mr. Paar spotted him and tapped him as his announcer and sidekick for “The Tonight Show.”Mr. Downs was married for 74 years to Ruth Shaheen, who died in 2017.

Wall Stree Journal,"Is the mass advertising boycott hitting Facebook Inc. FB 0.81% a meaningful turning point for the social-media king? Or is it just another public-relations storm it weathers on its way to joining the Trillion-Dollar Club?Companies like Coca-Cola and Unilever are pausing their social-media spend, citing a variety of reasons, most commonly their view that Facebook is not doing enough to eliminate hate speech, and the way the company’s products polarize and divide us all. Sound familiar? Accusations like this are leveled at the company with some regularity.The boycott has brought a great deal of attention to the issue. But it’s not Facebook’s first “we can do better” moment—there have been many, and there will probably be many more.The concerns raised by advertisers, also including Starbucks and Microsoft, can be answered with policy tweaks or public statements. But they can probably never be fixed to the satisfaction of everyone who feels invested in the behavior of Facebook because of the nature of political discourse in America and beyond—and because of the nature of Facebook itself as a digital forum and a business.The content critics flag as unacceptable ranges from posts that seem unambiguously hateful or maliciously dishonest to content a significant share of the country might consider part of the political conversation, even if they disagree with it.The Anti-Defamation League, part of a coalition that pushed many advertisers toward a boycott, compiled several examples of the type of typically right-leaning hate speech and misinformation it says is still often accompanied by ads from big-name brands. One was a spoofed image of a woman in a head scarf on an Aunt Jemima-like syrup bottle with the label “Aunt Jihadi.” Another, on a conspiracy group’s page, claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency is trying to start civil war “just like the days of Hitler,” and includes a photo of a military force rolling through an urban street, captioned “MARTIAL LAW, FEMA Coffins In The USA.”But the current backlash owes in large part to Facebook’s handling of President Trump’s posts on Twitter and Facebook saying “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter flagged it for “glorifying violence.” Facebook left it alone, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg arguing that it’s not Facebook’s place to regulate political speech—a position that infuriated plenty of his own employees.In discussions of free speech, Facebook is sometimes likened to a modern town square, but there’s no precedent in history for it. No town square could ever fit a third of the world’s population, let alone give a megaphone to each of those people.And nothing of that size could ever be imagined to be governed by one billionaire and his private army of bots and humans. Facebook would like to depend on users and algorithms, but it is increasingly dependent on thousands of low-paid contractors to interpret its myriad guidelines about what constitutes permissible content.All of which helps explain why, to the question of who should draw lines around what exactly is and isn’t acceptable speech, Mr. Zuckerberg has long favored the answer: “Not us.”SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat fixes, if any, could Facebook and similar platforms make to address concerns around hate speech? Join the conversation below.After years of being frustrated by Facebook’s perceived inaction, a few groups of academics and civil-rights activists began last November to discuss encouraging advertisers to boycott Facebook, says Tristan Harris, president and co-founder of the nonprofit Center for Humane Technology. He’s been advising the boycott movement, called “Stop Hate for Profit,” which, in addition to the ADL, includes the NAACP, Color of Change and others.Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, said that at a June 1 meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, he became frustrated with the company’s inaction, specifically its failure to apply its hate-speech policies to posts by President Trump, and its failure to bring in an executive with civil-rights experience. “Toward the end of the conversation I told Mark and Sheryl, ‘What are we doing here, where we ask for things, and you tell us you’re doing things you’re not really doing?’”Amid months of coronavirus-induced lockdowns and bleak economic reports, the video of a Minneapolis police officer killing George Floyd had gone viral and nationwide protests ensued. The ADL saw an explosion of hate speech and conspiracy theories online, which catalyzed the group and its partners to act, says its chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt. Cue the boycott.Some advertisers have said that pausing spending on Facebook is solely about “brand safety,” making sure their ads don’t appear with objectionable content. Verizon, for example, has clarified that it is not joining the Stop Hate movement.Related VideoTwitter vs. Facebook: The Evolving Moderation of the PresidentFacebook and Twitter have taken different stances on moderating President Trump on their platforms. It's the latest controversy in an ongoing debate about the responsibility tech companies have in policing speech online. Photo illustration: Carter McCall/WSJOthers are riding the same cultural tidal wave that saw brands posting on social media in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Coca-Cola issued a statement, citing racism on the platforms as well as the social-media industry’s lack of accountability and transparency about where ads appear. A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said the company is not officially joining the Stop Hate For Profit boycott.Facebook has said it plans to work with the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, an initiative of the World Federation of Advertisers, which is working on creating standards for what constitutes hate speech and other advertiser-unfriendly content. Facebook will also submit to its first-ever audit by the Media Ratings Council. The aim is self-regulation, similar to the content rating systems found in the videogame and film industries, says Robert Rakowitz, head of GARM.Interactive: Facebook Faces an Advertiser Boycott. Will Its Business Take a Hit?STEPHANIE STAMMThe businesses withholding ad dollars represent only a fraction of Facebook’s revenue, however. Most of that comes from small and medium-size companies. But with public pressure still gaining momentum, there’s a chance more could come of this.So what exactly might a “fixed” Facebook even look like? There is little consensus.Some focus on overhauling Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which exempts internet platforms from liability for the things people say and do on their platforms. Proposals to curtail or end those protections for Facebook and its rivals have come from both the right and the left.Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) has suggested giving the Federal Trade Commission expanded powers to review Facebook’s content-related decisions, examining them for bias.Others, including Mr. Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, think a better alternative could be something publicly funded, a sort of Public Broadcasting System for social media. That would be an enormously complicated new undertaking, with its own tricky set of First Amendment issues.Facebook has never been a company that stands mute in the face of criticism. The company has in the past commissioned independent human-rights assessments and promised sweeping changes. Just this week, it announced it would delete hundreds of accounts and groups devoted to the boogaloo movement, a loose confederation of mostly young white men obsessed with guns, violence and perceived slights to their freedom, which formed online and aims to start a civil war in the U.S.The endless game of Whac-A-Mole Facebook plays with these kinds of fringe groups illustrates how much its strategy depends on reaction to critics, says Mr. Harris. But it also reflects that, with a service accessed by 2.6 billion people around the world, in a hundred different languages, addressing all the possible ways Facebook can be used—and misused—is virtually impossible, he adds.One of the Stop Hate For Profit movement’s key requests is for Facebook to appoint a C-level executive with deep civil-rights expertise who examines products and policies for evidence of discrimination and hate.It is hard to imagine how that role would fit in Facebook’s hierarchy. Facebook has had senior executives with the power to do such reviews, including Joel Kaplan, head of global public policy, and Chris Cox, head of product, who just returned to Facebook a year after departing over disagreements with Mr. Zuckerberg.Mr. Kaplan, a conservative at a company whose employees overwhelmingly lean liberal, has watered down or scuttled many of the initiatives of engineers at Facebook that had the potential to make its product less divisive with users, The Wall Street Journal reported in May. He did this in part because he was concerned they would disproportionately affect conservative media and voices on the site, according to the Journal. Mr. Cox was responsible for many of those failed initiatives before he left the company.Mark Zuckerberg walks with Facebook Vice President of Global Public Policy Joel Kaplan on Capitol HIll in September.PHOTO: SAMUEL CORUM/GETTY IMAGESFacebook’s response to the boycott campaign so far has mixed a little fine-tuning with a lot of stay-the-course. Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of communications, wrote on July 1 that the company has a zero-tolerance policy toward hate speech, but that finding hate on Facebook’s 100 billion daily messages is like finding a needle in a haystack. The company has tripled its safety and security team to 35,000 people, he added.The company also posted a list of responses to the specific demands of the Stop Hate movement. Among these are expanding a “brand safety hub” to let advertisers view their ads next to more types of Facebook content. Expanding this would entail “substantial technical challenges,” the company said.Another covered the question of potentially violating content in private groups. The company said it’s “exploring ways to make a group’s moderators more accountable for the content,” but points out that permitting or posting violating content already incurs penalties that can result in a group being closed down.In a June 26 post on Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg announced that the company will crack down on attempts at voter suppression leading up to the November election, that Facebook identifies close to 90% of hate speech posted to the site before anyone reports it, and that the company will get tough on hate speech in advertisements. Mr. Zuckerberg has also agreed to meet with organizers of the boycott.The organizers have zeroed in on the idea that above all, in business, money talks. And their campaign could yet spur more substantive action from Facebook. The boycott managed to depress Facebook’s stock price, but only temporarily. The extent of the damage—and the extent of Facebook’s response—will likely depend on how big this boycott gets.For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-boycott-got-facebooks-attentionbut-a-real-fix-is-nowhere-in-sight-11593723979
Wall Stree Journal,"Oil prices rose Thursday after employment data showed the U.S. economy gained more jobs than expected last month.U.S. crude futures for August delivery added 2.1% to $40.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing at their highest level since March 6.Prices edged higher after Labor Department data showed the U.S. added 4.8 million jobs in June, bringing the unemployment rate down to 11.1%. That increase was larger than economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected.Oil investors said Thursday’s strong employment report was a sign that the U.S. economy is recovering from the pandemic, despite a recent climb in cases. Recent data has indicated that the recovery could be slowing down, a concerning development for those betting on surging demand for crude.Recovering demand and record production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have helped return prices to their March levels. Still, stockpiles remain elevated after surging during the spring, and analysts are skeptical that demand will return to its prepandemic levels, especially as cases in big states like Texas, Florida and California continue to rise.In the U.S., crude stockpiles have started to come down. On Wednesday, weekly U.S. data showed crude inventories had fallen by 7.2 million barrels last week, a much bigger drop than the 100,000-barrel decline traders and analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that oil demand could reach precoronavirus levels by 2022, driven by growth in emerging economies, relatively low energy prices and rising sales of petrochemicals. Others, however, are less optimistic.“Future [oil] demand growth could be weaker than before [the coronavirus],” due to less flying and more working from home, said Citigroup analysts in a note.Meanwhile the number of rigs drilling for oil, a proxy for sector activity, declined in June. Oil rigs in operation world-wide fell by 103 last month to 1,073, according to data released Thursday by Baker Hughes. In the U.S., the oil-rig count was down 72 in June to 274.Brent crude futures for September delivery, the global gauge of oil prices, jumped 2.6% to $43.14 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange Thursday.Elsewhere in commodities, most actively traded gold futures recovered some of Wednesday’s losses, rising 0.6% to $1,790. Earlier in the week, gold futures breached $1,800, the highest level in almost nine years, as investors flock to the haven metal amid economic uncertainty and low interest rates on government bonds.EarlierThe Forces Fueling 2020’s Oil BustThe coronavirus pandemic has stalled factories and shut down business around the world, causing a historic drop in oil demand just as production was reaching new highs.

Wall Stree Journal,"U.S. government bond yields reversed an early climb and closed lower Thursday, with investors weighing persistent worries about the economic outlook against a better-than-expected monthly jobs report.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a key benchmark for borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to student loans, climbed above 0.71% in the wake of Thursday morning’s data, according to Tradeweb. But it then retraced the move, settling at 0.670%, compared with 0.682% on Wednesday. Bond yields rise as prices fall.Some analysts called the reversal a signal that investors believe that a full economic recovery will take time. The 10-year yield tends to rise and fall with investors’ expectations for growth and inflation and has traded within a relatively narrow range around 0.7% in recent weeks, a stall many attribute to economic worries and aggressive monetary stimulus.A curbside job fair in Grand Rapids, Mich., last month. Treasury yields initially rose after data showed the U.S. added 4.8 million jobs in June.PHOTO: ADAM BIRD FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALThe 10-year yield initially climbed after data showed that the jobless rate fell to 11.1% in June and that the U.S. added 4.8 million jobs, boosting hopes that the economy will avoid investors’ worst-case scenarios, but it reversed course later in the session, to snap a two-session streak of gains.Among the worries dragging on bond yields: concern that a recent resurgence in the pandemic will force new lockdowns. That could slow the recovery, prompting the central bank to keep interest rates low. It could also limit any pickup in inflation, increasing the appeal of government debt by preserving the purchasing power of its fixed-coupon payments.Even with big job gains in May and June, employment is still well below levels from early in the year. “With the spread of the virus accelerating again, we expect the recovery from here will be a lot bumpier and job gains far slower on average,” Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.Black Workers Face Slower Economic RecoveryBlack unemployment has historically been higher than white unemployment in the U.S. This gap was narrowing before the coronavirus pandemic. But with unemployment hitting record highs across the board, Black Americans could be left even further behind. Photo illustration: Carter McCall/WSJAsset managers, including Neuberger Berman, expect the economy will grow over the next year, but remain cautious.“We are unable to reconcile the size and speed of the stock market rebound at the beginning of June with what is likely to be a gradual reopening process and moderate medium-term growth,” said Erik Knutzen, chief investment officer of multiasset-class at Neuberger Berman.Analysts expect the economy won’t return to precrisis levels before the end of next year.

Wall Stree Journal,"Iranian authorities said they were investigating a blast Thursday at the country’s main nuclear facility that caused damage to a building identified by experts as an advanced centrifuge assembly plant.The explosion at Natanz—which houses Iran’s biggest uranium enrichment facility—occurred in the early hours of the day and set fire to a building that contained no nuclear material, according to Iranian officials who visited the site. The building was damaged but there were no casualties, the officials said. Experts said sabotage was a possibility.“Experts are investigating the cause of the incident and also its dimensions,” Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for Iran’s atomic agency told state television during a visit to Natanz, some 180 miles south of Tehran.Mr. Kamalvandi said there was no interruption to enrichment activities, which are conducted underground, describing the damaged building as a shed located in the Ahmadi Roshan complex.“Since there was not any kind of nuclear material in this shed, there is no contamination despite rumors and propaganda of the opposition media,” he said, likely referring to online reports of possible contamination.Earlier in the day, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, visited the site. A spokesman for the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency said it was in contact with Iranian authorities over the incident to determine whether it would be able to continue its monitoring work at the site.The explosion at Natanz is the second accident to take place at a sensitive site in Iran in the past week. A blast occurred at a Defense Ministry facility east of Tehran last Friday, near a military site that has been crucial for Iran’s development of missiles and munitions. The ministry attributed the explosion to an industrial gas tank in a civilian area of Parchin.While Iranian officials played down any suggestion of sabotage and there was no evidence it had occurred, the country’s nuclear facilities, including Natanz, have been the target of operations in the past.The U.S. and Israel have successfully targeted Iran’s nuclear program in the past, destroying centrifuges, infiltrating computer systems and disrupting enrichment at Natanz via a high-tech cyber sabotage project known as Stuxnet, which was developed by the Central Intelligence Agency in conjunction with the Israeli government and other U.S. agencies.Israel also was believed to be behind a campaign of assassinations of Iranian scientists working on Iran’s nuclear program in the early 2010s.Ramezanali Ferdowsi Badi, governor of Natanz, on Thursday dismissed speculation about an attack on the site as “completely baseless” in comments published by student news agency ISNA.David Albright, a former weapons inspector who is president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., said the fire at Natanz occurred in a building his organization had identified as an advanced centrifuge assembly plant in 2017. He said IAEA inspectors have visited the site and Iranian officials had given people tours of the site.Mr. Albright said he believed the site was at least partially operational. While images suggested the explosion did serious structural damage to the building, it may have occurred in an area housing diesel generators rather than the assembly area, according to the institute.The building is one of a number of aboveground facilities dotting the Natanz site related to nuclear work. Given the site’s importance to the manufacture of advanced centrifuges, he said the fire may have been sabotage.Under the nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to continue enriching uranium to low grades at Natanz. It was also allowed to do a very small amount of research work on more advanced centrifuges but over time, it would have been free to scale up that work.However with the U.S. decision to exit from the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal in 2018, Iran has scaled back its compliance with the accord and has announced a big expansion in its work on more advanced centrifuges which can enrich uranium far more quickly.But experts say that work has likely advanced slowly. Iran took years to produce a workable IR-1 centrifuge, the most basic kind of machine that was used in Europe and the U.S. decades ago.—Isabel Coles in Beirut contributed to this article.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-says-it-is-investigating-explosion-at-main-nuclear-site-11593723339
Wall Stree Journal,"U.S. stocks jumped Thursday after the June employment report showed the economy added more jobs than expected, reassuring investors that the recovery is continuing.The U.S. regained 4.8 million jobs last month, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 11.1% from 13.3% in May. That marked the second consecutive month that employers added jobs since massive waves of layoffs gripped the country earlier in the coronavirus pandemic. Both figures beat the expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.All three major U.S. indexes finished the day and the week higher, despite seeing Thursday’s gains ease in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day up 92.39 points, or 0.4%, to 25827.36. The blue-chip index had initially surged nearly 470 points to start the day, rising on excitement surrounding the jobs report.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 jumped 14.15 points, or 0.5% to 3130.01, notching its fourth day of gains. The index’s rally was broad-based, with nine of the index’s 11 sectors ending the day higher.Materials and energy stocks were among the companies that led the march, with Diamondback Energy adding 5%, while Vulcan Materials climbed 4.2%.Growth stocks rallied, too. Google parent Alphabet added 1.9% and Tesla surged 8% after the electric car maker said Thursday that its second-quarter global deliveries fell less than expected. Amazon.com, meanwhile, edged up 0.4%, helping the company to notch its ninth consecutive weekly gain—its longest weekly winning streak on record.Those jumps in momentum stocks pushed the Nasdaq Composite to a new all-time-high. The tech-heavy index gained 53 points, or 0.5% to 10207.63.“This continues the trend that we’ve seen here of economic data coming in stronger than expected,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer of Plante Moran Financial Advisors. “It all points to a recovery that is clearly under way.”All three indexes finished the week up 3.2% or more, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials seeing their largest weekly increases since the first week of June. The Nasdaq, in comparison, clinched its highest one-week gain since the week ending May 8.Markets are closed Friday for the Independence Day holiday.Investors said this week’s increases could put stocks on track for another rally after largely being stuck in a narrow trading pattern in June.Yet at the same time, some noted, potential obstacles to a full economic recovery loom. Even with Thursday’s employment gains, the jobless rate is still at historically high levels and the U.S. labor market is operating with about 15 million fewer jobs than in February.Even more, much of the data from Thursday’s jobs report was collected in mid-June, while local economic re-openings were under way. A recent rise in coronavirus infections—which has paused or reversed reopening plans in some states—could dampen next month’s employment gains.Stock Market Logs Best Quarter in Decades, While Inovio Shares FallThe stock market had a remarkable second-quarter rally, while Inovio shares recently tumbled. WSJ’s Paul Vigna breaks down this week’s winners and losers. Photo: Richard B. Levine/Zuma PressWeekly unemployment claims data, which offer a more up-to-date view on the U.S. labor market, showed the number of new applications for jobless benefits fell by 55,000 to 1.43 million last week.The number of applications for jobless benefits filed every week has come down from a peak of nearly 7 million in late March, but has stabilized near a historically high 1.5 million, signaling that companies are still cutting jobs.Investors said they would be looking to see if June’s added jobs result in an uptick in consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-third of U.S. economic activity.“Everybody is obviously watching the changes in the American labor market,” said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg Bank. “The U.S. consumer is the most important driver of the global economy.”Along with any clues from the Federal Reserve, investors will also be watching in the weeks ahead to see if U.S. political leaders offer additional stimulus measures.Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said the June jobs report suggests the Paycheck Protection Program, which was created by Congress in March to provide small businesses with payroll and expenses relief, is starting to help the economy. But, he added, investors are now focused on the “second-order effects.” They are looking to see if investors are paying down debt, and where in particular they are spending.A recent surge in coronavirus cases, however, could complicate some of those shopping plans.

Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed by unanimous consent a bipartisan bill to impose sanctions on Chinese officials who threaten Hong Kong’s limited autonomy, as well as the banks and firms that do business with them, sending the legislation to the president’s desk.The bill, sponsored by Sens. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) and Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.), passed the House on Wednesday, as thousands of protesters took to the streets in Hong Kong to object to a new law that gives Beijing stronger powers to police the former British colony and punish those accused of subversion and separatism. The law carries penalties of up to life imprisonment.The legislation now heads to President Trump. The White House hasn’t responded to a request for comment over whether the president will support the bill.Lawmakers said the legislation moved faster through Congress than expected because of the aggressive actions by Beijing in recent days. Wednesday’s protests in Hong Kong were the largest show of defiance in the city this year, with some people risking heavy prison terms to chant slogans of liberation and demand independence.“The intensity of the Chinese Communist Party’s aggression appears to be growing by the day,” said Mr. Toomey, citing the arrests of Hong Kong protesters on Wednesday.“I hope that President Trump will sign this immediately,” Mr. Van Hollen said. “As a country, Republicans and Democrats need to send a strong signal that we will not stand for the actions of Beijing undermining their own agreements, agreements under international law which they are bound to.”Last year, Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which reaffirmed and amended a 1992 act requiring the State Department to certify annually that Hong Kong is independent enough from Beijing to retain favored trading status with the U.S.In May, the State Department certified to Congress that Hong Kong was no longer autonomous, opening the way for Mr. Trump to take a range of possible measures, from revoking trade arrangements to imposing sanctions.Related VideoFree Speech Under Siege as Hong Kong TV Show Comes to EndUnder pressure from China, Hong Kong has been chipping away at the territory’s free speech, which is a key pillar of the city’s identity.

Photo/Video: Clément Bürge/WSJMORENew Security Law Prompts Rise in Self-CensorshipHundreds Arrested in DemonstrationsWhat’s in Hong Kong’s New National-Security LawHong Kong Market Accentuates the PositiveHeard on the Street: It’s No Longer Business as UsualMr. Van Hollen said the new sanctions bill was needed because the Trump administration has taken “very tepid” steps since. The legislation that passed on Thursday would allow the administration to sanction more people because it expands the focus. It also allows for sanctions of financial institutions that conduct significant transactions with individuals who are sanctioned.Senators cited the examples for possible sanctions under this bill of a police unit cracking down on protesters or Chinese Communist Party officials responsible for imposing the new law on Hong Kong.The bill includes a provision that gives Congress the ability to override a president’s decision to waive or terminate sanctions through a joint resolution of disapproval. Such a resolution would have to pass both the House and Senate by a veto-proof two-thirds majority.Since Hong Kong is a global financial hub, banks and their lawyers are worried the bill would generate compliance headaches or sanctions against financial institutions that allow significant financial transactions involving Chinese government officials or others blamed for imposing the security law on Hong Kong or eroding the city’s autonomy.Several global financial institutions have a presence in mainland China and in Hong Kong, so those banks would need to develop software and client questionnaires to reduce the risk of running afoul of the legislation, trade lawyers say.It isn’t clear whether the U.S. Treasury Department would pursue financial sanctions related to Hong Kong in the same manner that it has against Iranian and Russian institutions. Still, the bill would give the Treasury Department, in consultation with the State Department, the power to identify financial institutions that allow transactions among sanctioned parties and inform Congress.The executive branch would then be required to roll out sanctions over time, although the president could cancel the sanctions if enough lawmakers supported such a move.The State Department declined requests for comment on the legislation. The Treasury Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Earlier this week, lawmakers of both parties introduced a separate bill to give refugee status to Hong Kong residents at risk of persecution under China’s national-security law.—William Mauldin contributed to this article.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-passes-sanctions-bill-against-chinese-officials-over-hong-kong-11593707277

Commercial chapter 11 filings were up 43% last month from June of last year.“In challenging economic environments, companies attempt to file at the right time to capture the best outcomes at the end of the lengthy process,” said Deirdre O’Connor, managing director for Epiq Corporate Restructuring.There have been more than 500 chapter 11 filings under new bankruptcy rules in place since late February, designed to help small businesses move through the process more quickly and lower paperwork costs.MORE FROM WSJ PRO BANKRUPTCYSycamore Bids $540 Million for Ann Taylor, Other Ascena Brands November 26, 2020U.S. Found Not Responsible for Puerto Rico Bond Losses November 23, 2020Offshore Oil-Rig Operator Noble Cleared to Exit Chapter 11 November 23, 2020A bigger rise in bankruptcies is likely to be seen in the coming months as federal Paycheck Protection Program funds and other assistance programs run out for small and midsize businesses, said Rachael Smiley, a bankruptcy lawyer at Dallas-based law firm Ross & Smith PC.“We may be on borrowed time for job cuts in a number of industries…that were not necessarily distressed when we entered the pandemic,” Ms. Smiley said.A number of prominent companies filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2020, including department-store chain J.C.

That is significantly lower than the nearly 41,200 job cuts due to bankruptcies from January through June 2019.This year’s bankruptcy-related job cuts were led by retail, the services sector and the entertainment and leisure industry. The majority of the bankruptcy-related layoffs for all of 2019 were in retail.Last year was particularly severe for bankruptcy job losses. The number hit more than 62,000 in 2019, the highest level since 2005.“How many job cuts result from bankruptcy depends on the type of companies filing for bankruptcy,” said Jonathan Carson, chief executive of Stretto, a bankruptcy and technology services firm. “Some companies that file chapter 11, with the intention of reorganizing their business, by and large can happen in a way that involves very few job cuts.

Wall Stree Journal,"Exxon Mobil Corp. warned Thursday of steep losses in its refining and oil-and-gas production businesses during the second quarter, signaling that the company is likely to report a second straight quarterly loss later this month.Lower oil and gas prices are poised to drag down production profits by an estimated $2.5 billion to $3.1 billion compared with the first quarter, Exxon XOM -1.52% said in a regulatory filing. That unit reported $536 million in profit in the first quarter.Exxon expects that tighter margins on turning oil into fuels such as gasoline and diesel and higher costs associated with moving crude around North America will reduce refining profits by some $800 million to $1.2 billion from the prior quarter.

Wall Stree Journal,"Tesla Inc.’s second-quarter global deliveries fell 4.9% from a year earlier, a much smaller decline than Wall Street had forecast, underpinning Chief Executive Elon Musk’s ambitious growth plans despite the coronavirus pandemic and threat of an extended recession.The results may fuel heightened investor expectations for the next six months as they bet 2020 will be the year Tesla turns a full-year profit.Shares in Tesla, which have more than doubled this year, closed up almost 8% on Thursday. The stock opened the day above $1,200 for the first time ever. Investor enthusiasm, even amid the pandemic, has made the electric-car company the world’s largest auto maker by market value, overtaking Toyota Motor Corp.The Silicon Valley company delivered 90,650 vehicles in the April-through-June selling period, compared with 95,356 a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, expected 72,000 deliveries after Tesla’s lone U.S. assembly plant, in Fremont, Calif., was closed for almost half the quarter as California authorities put measures in place to slow the spread of Covid-19.A newly operational factory in China that continued to pump out cars while Fremont was closed, leftover inventory from the first quarter, price cuts and Mr. Musk’s defiance over local authorities in California to resume vehicle production seemed to have helped the company.Global auto-industry sales are expected to have fallen 34% in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to researcher LMC Automotive. Toyota, General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., this week reported U.S. vehicle sales in the second quarter fell by more than 30%.Ford on Thursday said its results were hurt disproportionately by a drop in sales to businesses and rental-car companies. Its second-quarter sales to retail customers, or individual buyers, fell 14% from a year earlier.Tesla doesn’t break out U.S. results. “While our main factory in Fremont was shut down for much of the quarter, we have successfully ramped production back to prior levels,” the company said Thursday.Second-quarter deliveries rose 2.4% from the first quarter, when the pandemic first began to affect the business. New compact offerings, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport-utility vehicle, accounted for 80,050 of Tesla’s vehicle deliveries in the quarter, the company said.“In our opinion, a 90k delivery number in this COVID lockdown environment is a jaw dropper and the bulls will run with this as a potential paradigm changer moving ahead,” Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors.The latest figures give the best indication yet of how the coronavirus may affect earlier plans by Mr. Musk to increase global deliveries by more than 36% this year, part of a multiyear push that would see Tesla evolve from a niche player into one with factories on three continents and millions of vehicles sold.How the Coronavirus Pandemic Is Changing the Way We CommuteTraveling on trains and buses means potential exposure to the coronavirus, so cities are racing to make their public transit systems safe. WSJ explores how things like sanitizing robots, working from home and expanded bike lanes are changing our commutes. Video/Illustration: Jaden Urbi and Zoë SorianoThe year began promising after the company finished the third and fourth quarters last year with a profit and Wall Street analysts predicted 2020 could be the first full year in which Tesla was profitable since it was founded in July 2003. Forecasts were based on Tesla’s business being powered by the arrival of the Model Y and new China sales generated from the company’s first overseas assembly factory, which would help lower costs for local buyers.Then the coronavirus pandemic forced car makers around the globe to temporarily shut plants.To counter the potential loss of business, Tesla early and aggressively tried to cut costs, furloughing factory workers, slashing pay and seeking breaks on rent from landlords.Mr. Musk also fought efforts by local authorities to keep the California factory closed, arguing that the virus wasn’t as risky as officials feared and the threat of an economic shutdown was greater. He eventually opened the Fremont factory in early May against the wishes of local authorities, daring them to arrest him, which they didn’t.During the second quarter, Tesla built 82,272 vehicles, down from about 87,000 a year earlier, the company said.Despite the rocky start to the period, analysts increasingly believed Tesla could salvage some of the quarter with a final push. The average estimate of analysts rose in the final days of the period to 72,000 deliveries from 66,000, according to FactSet. That was still much lower than the 125,000 expected by analysts in February.The renewed optimism came as Mr. Musk pushed his workers to end the quarter strong, telling them in an email this week that “breaking even is looking super tight.” The company won’t report the bottom-line impact of the turbulent period for a few weeks.The CEO’s personal fortune is closely linked to the company’s growth. Mr. Musk must guide Tesla to meeting targets for revenue, market value and adjusted operating profit in order for him to earn his entire compensation package, valued at more than $50 billion by 2028. One target, for example, calls for Tesla to increase annual sales by 15 times from 2017 levels.Mr. Musk has other motivations to push Tesla hard. Even the slightest profit could make Tesla eligible for consideration to become part of the prestigious S&P 500, which would drive index funds to include the company’s shares in their holdings.A company needs four consecutive quarters to add up to a profit, including the most recent one, to be considered. A surprise first-quarter profit means Tesla is on the brink of that achievement.Even before the latest results, analysts were still estimating Tesla could turn a full-year profit in 2020. They predict a second-quarter loss of $351 million, though analysts are predicting the loss would be offset by a surge of business in the second half of the year ending with a total of 436,000 vehicles delivered.That is below what Mr. Musk initially targeted. Tesla said in late April that it would update its full-year expectations after the second quarter.Efforts to stop the spread of the Covid-19 disease in the Golden State has been a double-whammy for Mr. Musk. It disrupted Tesla’s vehicle production and has threatened to hamper the company’s largest U.S. market as buyers sheltered at home amid fears of infection.California accounted for 40% of Tesla’s U.S. vehicle registrations last year, according to IHS Markit. Registrations of Tesla vehicles in the state in the first two months of the second quarter fell 37% from a year ago, underscoring the battle the company faced in trying to catch up, according to researcher Cross-Sell data. Tesla tends to deliver proportionally more cars in California in the final weeks of the quarter, close to its factory, while sending cars and SUVs to the East Coast and overseas earlier in the period to allow for shipping time. That can make the final weeks of a quarter crucial to its success.China has been Tesla’s second-largest market by revenue. Earlier registration data suggested its new factory in Shanghai would help second-quarter results. The locally made Model 3 saw a dip in registrations in April for 3,635 vehicles, rebounding to a record 11,095 in May. June results haven’t been announced yet.With a big June push, researcher JL Warren Capital LLC estimates total Tesla registrations in China may have totaled 31,198 during the second quarter—fewer than it had previously expected, in part, because of how Covid-19 shutdowns have affected the company.MOREHeard on the Street: Down Is the New Up for TeslaAfter the results were released, Mr. Musk took to Twitter to gloat as the market’s positive reaction has proven costly to investors betting against the company through short selling the stock. Tesla shares ended the abbreviated trading week up 26%.“Tesla will make fabulous short shorts in radiant red satin with gold trim,” he posted around lunchtime in California. “Will send some to the Shortseller Enrichment Commission to comfort them through these difficult times.”The “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” was a term he used on Twitter in 2018 after settling with the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims he misled investors with tweets saying he had secured funding to take the auto maker private.On Thursday, Mr. Musk later tweeted: “SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon’s.” The quip drew a response from a vocal supporter, Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor, who seemed to caution Mr. Musk by posting: “Dangerous.”Mr. Musk responded: “But sooo satisfying.”Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-deliveries-fell-in-second-quarter-amid-covid-shutdown-11593692772

Nevertheless, it is likely to remain above the pre-coronavirus pandemic level of about 3.5% through the end of the decade. The Labor Department on Thursday reported the rate fell to 11.1% in June from 13.3% in May.Black Workers Face Slower Economic RecoveryBlack unemployment has historically been higher than white unemployment in the U.S. This gap was narrowing before the coronavirus pandemic. But with unemployment hitting record highs across the board, Black Americans could be left even further behind.

But that won’t be enough to overcome the impact of widespread business closures earlier in the year.Output in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be 5.9% lower than a year earlier, the agency said, worse than the 5.6% drop it projected in May. Though the economy is likely to grow 4.8% next year, it won’t return to its pre-pandemic size until mid-2022, it said.The bounceback will likely be followed by a long, slow recovery similar to the pace of the previous decadelong economic expansion, when growth averaged around 2% a year, the CBO said. Unemployment is expected to average 6.1 percent a year through 2030.The agency said its forecasts assume that social-distancing measures “gradually diminish to zero” from the third quarter of this year through the third quarter of 2021. But it acknowledged that projections are highly uncertain, given incomplete knowledge about the severity of the pandemic and the prospects for developing treatments or a vaccine.The U.S. economy was humming in February when the coronavirus pandemic triggered widespread business closures and travel restrictions designed to stem the outbreak, bringing economic activity to a standstill and ending the longest expansion in U.S. history.“The economic outlook for 2020 to 2030 has deteriorated significantly since the agency last published its full baseline economic projections in January,” CBO director Phillip Swagel said in Thursday’s report.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbo-sees-double-digit-jobless-rate-through-2020-gdp-to-shrink-5-9-11593714287
Wall Stree Journal,"When he resigned as commander in chief of Britain’s Virginia forces in the French and Indian War in 1758, the 26-year-old George Washington put aside his military ambitions and returned to his Mount Vernon plantation for good. (Or so he thought.) Naturally enough, the young man started out as a traditional slaveholding Southern tobacco planter like his father and grandfathers before him. Yet in the decades that followed, a remarkable transformation took place. By the time he died in 1799, Washington had turned his back on the whole ethos of Southern agrarianism that was so dear to fellow Virginians like Thomas Jefferson. The planter had become an entrepreneurial proto-capitalist. Toward the end of his life, Washington said that, if there were any way to pull it off, he’d sell all his Virginia property and move to a northern city to make his living as an investor. Washington’s experiences in war and government had convinced him to embrace investment, commerce, finance and, as John Berlau reveals with a short but lively book, entrepreneurship. In “George Washington,Entrepreneur” the author, an economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, presents an aspect of Washington’s leadership that will be unfamiliar to many readers.Mount Vernon always remained the center of Washington’s entrepreneurial endeavors. He turned the old plantation into what Mr. Berlau calls an “industrial village.” The first, essential step was abandoning tobacco, the soil-depleting crop that had been the foundation of the Chesapeake economy since the first English settlers arrived in the early 17th century. Washington experimented with as many as 60 different grain crops before fixing on wheat as his new mainstay. Other landowners throughout the region were making this same shift from planter to farmer—grain crops were eclipsing tobacco. What set Washington apart was the scale of his operations on the constellation of Mount Vernon farms that he had expanded to 8,000 acres. Guided by the theories and practices of Britain’s new scientific agriculture, Mr. Berlau suggests, Washington established himself as the most progressive large-scale farmer in America.PHOTO: WSJGEORGE WASHINGTON, ENTREPRENEURBy John BerlauAll Points, 262 pages, $28.99George Washington at Mount Vernon.PHOTO: CORBIS VIA GETTY IMAGESFarmer Washington didn’t limit himself to growing wheat. In an early example of vertical integration, the master of Mount Vernon not only raised quantities of grain but ground it into flour in his own state-of-the-art automated grist mill; packaged it in sacks marked with his “G. Washington” brand; and marketed it throughout North America, the Caribbean and Britain. To secure control of the product from seed to sale, Washington made sure much of the flour left Mount Vernon’s wharf aboard his own oceangoing transports. Buyers soon learned that “G. Washington” assured consistent quality. Mr. Berlau notes that this sort of use of brand name by Washington and others foreshadowed the widespread use of commercial trademarks. The wheat fields also supported another profitable enterprise—a whiskey distillery whose annual production of the intoxicant (about 11,000 gallons) was one of the largest in America.Washington harvested the Potomac River—visible from the breezy east porch at Mount Vernon—as well. During the annual spring breeding runs of shad and herring, the two-mile-wide river churned with migrating fish from shore to shore. Washington’s fishing fleet of small boats (crewed by enslaved people) stayed on the water for weeks, laying out nets hundreds of feet long. Mount Vernon’s own extensive textile industry had woven the nets. In a good year, those nets might ensnare 1.5 million fish. The catch was gutted, salted and packed into barrels. The fish helped feed the enslaved population at Mount Vernon and found an export market abroad. (Mr. Berlau notes that many of these vital industries have been restored and are re-enacted at today’s Mount Vernon estate, the privately owned and operated exhibition complex that is one of America’s most visited historic house museums.)GEORGE WASHINGTON, ENTREPRENEURBy John BerlauAll Points, 262 pages, $28.99While the author chronicles Washington’s transformation from farmer to entrepreneur, he hardly considers the political turmoil that shaped it. Two rival visions of the American future battled for supremacy in President Washington’s first cabinet, and through this ideological clash of two fundamentally opposed conceptions of the republican experiment, the first American political parties were taking shape. The human poles around which these embryonic parties coalesced were Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton.Hamilton’s was the Federalist party. Federalists looked toward a consolidated nation with a vigorous federal government. The big cities of the North were their natural realm. They supported banking and investment, trade and manufacturing, and a strong military. The Federalists promoted solid national credit while recognizing the uses of government indebtedness. They meant for the United States to become a great nation, a power among the powers of the earth.Jefferson’s party found its spiritual home among the fields of rural America, especially the plantations of the slaveholding South. They looked to an agrarian utopia in which generation after generation of sturdy farmers would pass honest, independent lives, far from cities and scheming money men. In the Federalists’ ambitious plans for national greatness, fearful Jeffersonians thought they saw the seeds of the centralized tyranny Americans had just revolted against. They opposed all of Hamilton’s initiatives to build a national economy.President Washington pleaded for peace and tried to remain above the growing struggle in the heart of his administration. But Jefferson and Hamilton could not be reconciled. Washingtoninsisted to the end of his life that he belonged to no party. But his own visions of the grandeur of America’s destiny and the promise its experiment in liberty held out for all of humanity, as well as his support for Hamilton’s program, made it clear that Washington was, by experience, temperamentand conviction, a true Federalist. With the coming of the 20th century, the rise of the richest and most powerful nation in world history would demonstrate that the final victory belonged to George Washington and Alexander Hamilton.Mr. Rhodehamel’s most recent book is “George Washington:The Wonder of the Age.” His book “Original Sin: White Supremacy and the Lincoln Assassination” will be published next year.",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/george-washington-entrepreneur-review-mount-vernon-industries-11593720755

The mood captured seems triumphant, the observations troglodytic. “Remember, men,” advises one particularly oleaginous newscaster. “If you come to work tomorrow and your secretary refuses to do the filing and you go home and your wife refuses to do the cooking, don’t blame them. Remember: You gave them the vote 50 years ago.”A moment or two later, an unidentified female voice offers a no-nonsense response: “We weren’t given anything. We took it.”The VoteBegins Monday, 9 p.m., PBSMORE TELEVISION REVIEWS‘Empires of New York’ Review: Big Apple, Bigger Characters November 25, 2020‘Uncle Frank’ Review: A Reluctant Road Trip Home November 24, 2020‘Texas 6’ Review: Smaller Team, Same Tenacity November 24, 2020‘Crazy, Not Insane’ Review: The Origins of Violence November 19, 2020How they got it—claimed it, seized it, wrested it—is the gist of “The Vote,” an expansive yet tautly constructed work of history erected by writer-director Michelle Ferrari atop well-defined thematic tentpoles, among them the idea that the vote for American women was far from a gift—it was the result of a fierce, bloody and protracted battle. It went on for almost 70 years, depending on where you start counting; suffice to say, the 19th Amendment was originally intended to be the 16th.Few will be surprised that voters with the franchise were reluctant to share it; how reluctant is sometimes shocking. But the point regularly made by the historians, writers and academics interviewed over the documentary’s two nights and four hours is that voting rights have always been a contentious issue in American politics. With November looming, “The Vote,” an “American Experience” presentation, is no nostalgia piece. It is quite beautiful, narrated wonderfully by Kate Burton, seamlessly edited by Nancy Novack and Ilya Chaiken and with period photographs and archival news footage that provide an often-dreamy journey through the national memory. Still, the ferocity and frustrations of the suffrage struggle are always front and center, and the points well-defined.Alice PaulPHOTO: LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, HARRIS & EWING.One of them concerns the consistent way in which various progressive movements thwarted each other in their efforts to make their constituencies “fully adult American citizens,” as former National Organization for Women president Eleanor Smeal describes it. Women were legally infantilized to a degree that now seems preposterous. But as the series presents them, the politics that surrounded the suffrage issue make perfectly absurd sense. The vote for women was forced to take a back seat when the fight for the 15th Amendment was being waged: Giving black men and all women the vote at the same time was considered too much for America to swallow, even by otherwise staunch suffragist allies like Frederick Douglass. Race was always part of the voting-rights crusade, for both good and bad, from the abolitionists who brought together the celebrated 1848 women’s rights convention in Seneca Falls to the white pro-suffrage interests who wanted to hide their black members—African-American journalist-activist Ida B. Wells being just one example—during the massive march on Washington of 1913. The fear was lost support in the South.But something or other always seems to get in the women’s way, as the story progresses from decade to decade, and then century to century: The Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, white supremacist Southern senators, the liquor industry (temperance being a feminist issue), World War I and Prohibition. (Interestingly, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 goes entirely unmentioned, despite the film’s otherwise sweeping approach to history.)Ida B. WellsPHOTO: UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO“The Vote” profiles and tracks the progress of a number of women who surface and resurface regularly through the sometimes-outrageous history being recounted. One is Alice Paul. After receiving her master’s at Penn, the Quaker-born New Jersey native traveled to England for further study and fell in with Christabel Pankhurst; her mother, Emmeline Pankhurst; and the rest of the frustrated British suffragist movement (“suffragette” was originally a put-down), which was about to move from ladylike resistance into vandalism, arson and the planting of bombs. Paul, already of the take-no-prisoners school, was arrested several times, went on hunger strikes and was subjected to forced feedings. She became a full-blown zealot. And a devout believer in zealotry.How she brought that home to America is an aspect of another of Ms. Ferrari’s narrative arcs: the way schisms inevitably erupt within social movements and how, even inadvertently, opposing forces can make for mutual advances. Paul and her temperamental opposite, Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, were a good example, as the series observes: Chapman had long favored a state-by-state strategy of getting the vote; Paul, a cannier strategist who knew they’d never get the Southern states (and never did), promoted the idea of a federal amendment, which eventually became suffragist policy. Catt wooed the recalcitrant President Woodrow Wilson, and put women to work on the war effort once Wilson reneged so famously on his campaign promises and slogan (“He Kept Us Out of War”). Paul and her supporters, ever defiant, maintained their months-long demonstration outside the White House, even as troop ships were leaving for Europe. This led to assaults and beatings by both counter-protesters and cops, more arrests and more forced feedings. But eventually Wilson folded. Whether he was cultivated successfully or embarrassed no one can say, though Ms. Ferrari’s interviewees conclude it was probably a little of both.Suffragists picket in front of the White House in Feb. 1917PHOTO: LIBRARY OF CONGRESS“The Vote” is something of a thriller, thanks to the way Ms. Ferrari and company bring matters down the home stretch. “Tennessee is a terrible place to have to put all your marbles,” notes writer Elaine Weiss as the 19th Amendment faces its last chance at ratification. What will happen? Everyone knows. But it’s a nail-biter nonetheless.Correction: An earlier version of this story omitted the name of one of the program’s editors.",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-vote-review-when-women-seized-suffrage-11593719925
Wall Stree Journal,"Unemployment fell and the U.S. economy regained 4.8 million jobs in June, but the recent surge in coronavirus infections could throw the recovery off course.The job growth followed May’s payroll gain of 2.7 million and showed people were getting back to work and the economy was healing faster than anticipated. Still, the U.S. labor market is operating with about 15 million fewer jobs than in February, the month before the pandemic struck the U.S., while the country faces an increase in coronavirus cases that has led some states and businesses to change course on reopenings.There already are signs the economy could be affected by the virus surge that started in late June, after surveys were completed for the jobs report. Restaurant seating in several large cities declined at the end of the month and credit-card spending eased, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Loyola Marymount University.Mr. Sohn said the data suggested that consumers, the driving force behind the U.S. economy, started to grow cautious as cases increased. “Normally we should be celebrating a gain of 4.8 million jobs, but there are dark clouds ahead of us dashing hope of a V-shaped recovery,” he said.The June unemployment rate fell to 11.1% from 13.3% in May, even though there were significantly more workers who were accurately counted as unemployed in June compared with previous surveys during the pandemic, according to the Labor Department.U.S. stocks rose as the employment figures brought reassurance that the economic recovery was continuing.Still, the jobless rate remains at historically high levels. Until March, before the pandemic drove the U.S. into a deep recession, the unemployment rate was hovering around a 50-year low of 3.5%.A curbside recruitment fair in Grand Rapids, Mich., in June.PHOTO: JAMES T. AREDDY/THE WALL STREET JOURNALHiring last month was supported by business reopenings and government aid. States across the U.S. reopened restaurants, gyms and salons that had been shut for several weeks to contain the virus’s spread. Small businesses that tapped federal loans through the Paycheck Protection Program continued to recall workers.Job gains in leisure and hospitality—a sector hard hit by the shutdowns—accounted for about 40% of June’s employment growth. Restaurants and bars were the main driver. But those workers are particularly vulnerable to renewed layoffs because a recent rise in cases in several states is causing governors to halt or roll back reopenings.In recent days, Texas required that bars close and Florida imposed new restrictions on bars. New York City delayed the reopening of indoor dining at restaurants. Thursday’s jobs report, which is based on survey data largely collected in mid-June, doesn’t reflect those recent government-mandated business closures and related layoffs.The number of new applications for jobless benefits—a proxy for layoffs—fell by 55,000 to 1.43 million last week, the Labor Department said in a separate report Thursday. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits, meanwhile, rose slightly by 59,000 to 19.3 million for the week ended June 20.Unemployment claims have come down from a peak of nearly seven million in late March but have stabilized near a historically high 1.5 million, an indication that companies continue to cut jobs.“We’re in the beginning of a slow recovery,” said Marianne Wanamaker, a labor economist at the University of Tennessee, who previously served as an economist in the Trump administration. “I think the recovery will stall out if we don’t get control of the virus.”The Congressional Budget Office, in new economic forecasts released Thursday, said it expected the unemployment rate to fall to 10.5% by December, down from an earlier forecast of 11.5%.Gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic output, is expected to climb 12.4% in the second half of the year, but not enough to offset the losses from the first half of the year, the report said. GDP is projected to shrink 5.9% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, CBO said, and grow 4.8% next year.Worker shifts rose 2.4% in the week ended June 28 from the prior week, but the gains were smaller in some states where coronavirus cases rose. Shifts last week increased 1.8% in California, 1.6% in Texas and 0.6% in Florida, according to Kronos, a Massachusetts workforce management software company.Tubing rental company Texas Tubes won’t be open to send customers floating down the 2-mile Comal River this Fourth of July weekend—normally one of the busiest times of the year for the New Braunfels, Texas, company.Last week it had to cease operations and lay off its staff of about 30 when Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the halt of water-recreation outfitters, said Texas Tubes’ owner, Coley Reno.“Our season is only so long, so if this thing goes to September, then we’re done for the year,” Mr. Reno said. He added that the tubing center’s closure would hit the small Texas city’s tourism economy because there would be fewer out-of-town guests to dine at restaurants and sleep in Airbnbs.Employers in sectors such as retail, health care and manufacturing added jobs in June. Companies recalled workers who were temporarily laid off due to the pandemic, helping drive down the number of unemployed Americans on temporary layoff by about five million from May to June. Meanwhile, the number who permanently lost their jobs rose by about 600,000 over that period.At the beginning of the pandemic, customer traffic declined and hiring froze at Teriyaki Madness, a Denver-based franchised restaurant chain.“But then people kind of woke up and said, ‘This could last for a while,’” said Michael Haith, the company’s chief executive.Pandemic PayrollsPayrolls have rebounded following a sharp decline caused by businesses closings during the coronavirus pandemic.Change in jobs since JanuaryAfter a steep drop, signs of recoveryService-providingAfter shedding 20.7 million jobs in April, the U.S. added millions of jobs for two months straight.

Now the fast-casual chain is adding 10 stores that will need 25 employees each in positions such as cook, cashier and general manager.President Trump celebrated the employment figures. “Our economy is roaring back,” he told reporters at the White House, adding that he was “really happy.”Mr. Trump said voters should be wary of replacing him in the November elections, saying that doing so would hurt the economy. He played down economic threats from the increasing spread of coronavirus. “The crisis is being handled,” Mr. Trump said.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat do you make of the latest jobs data? Join the conversation below.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, in a statement said the president was ignoring the recent rise in coronavirus cases and overall state of the economy.“We’re still in a deep, deep job hole because Donald Trump has so badly bungled the response to the coronavirus and now he has basically given up on responding at all,” Mr. Biden said. “There’s no victory to be celebrated. We’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse.”Declines in unemployment last month were uneven across racial groups. The jobless rate for white workers fell 2.3 percentage points to 10.1% in June. The unemployment rate for Black workers decreased 1.4 percentage points to 15.4%. The rate for Latino workers fell below that of Black workers, declining 3.1 percentage points to 14.5%.The economy entered a recession in February and appeared to begin a recovery as early as April. The speed at which businesses hire and consumers spend depends, in large part, on the course of the virus.

She worried it would be tough financially for gyms to rely on virtual classes.“It’s made me nervous,” she said. “How am I going to make my living doing what I enjoy for the next couple of years?”What PMI Numbers Won’t Tell YouIn recent years, purchasing managers indexes have become important indicators of where the global economy might be heading. But in the current slowdown, where small businesses were some of the hardest hit, PMI numbers may not be telling the full story. WSJ explains. Photo: Getty ImagesMs. Casebeer said she is eager to return to teaching classes even though she makes more on unemployment benefits, which include an extra $600 a week from a federal stimulus bill, than she would as a group-fitness instructor.“I like what I do enough to not necessarily care about keeping the extra $600,” Ms. Casebeer said. “I want to go back to work, and I want to go back to work safely.”The June jobs report will likely inform congressional debate over the next federal coronavirus relief bill. Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over whether to extend the additional $600 a week in jobless benefits, scheduled to run out at the end of July.Republicans have pointed to stronger-than-expected job growth as evidence workers no longer need expanded unemployment benefits. Democrats have argued that millions of people remain jobless and need extended aid to keep paying bills.NEWSLETTER SIGN-UPReal Time EconomicsThe latest economic news, analysis and data curated weekdays by WSJ's Jeffrey Sparshott.PREVIEWSUBSCRIBESome small businesses are already running through loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to help companies keep workers on payrolls.“Many owners received their loans in April and can no longer afford to keep workers past June,” the National Federation of Independent Business said.Jennifer Cumming owns Foundational Concepts, two physical therapy clinics in Overland Park, Kan., and Kansas City, Mo.

Wall Stree Journal,"Surging coronavirus cases in major meat-producing states are testing safeguards that the U.S. meat industry has implemented to protect employees and their meat production after a wave of infections forced widespread plant shutdowns in April.New Covid-19 infections in recent days have jumped to a record level in Georgia, the largest chicken-producing state, with similar surges in other big poultry-producing states including Arkansas, Alabama and North Carolina. Rapid growth in new cases is raising fears among some employees that they remain at risk at work.Production in the $213 billion U.S. meat industry over the past few weeks has returned to normal levels, as companies including Tyson Foods Inc., Cargill Inc., Smithfield Foods Inc. and JBS USA Holdings Inc. ramped up processing lines and ran extra shifts on weekends. For the week ended June 27, beef production ran 5% higher than the same period a year ago, and pork production jumped nearly 14%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Chicken production fell about 2%. Beef- and pork-plant employees were hit hardest by the spring wave of infections.Over the past few weeks, coronavirus infections on a per capita basis in counties around beef and pork plants have risen, though at a rate similar to the national average, said Will Sawyer, an economist with agricultural lender CoBank. Several months ago, cases around meatpacking plants were climbing at a much faster rate than in the rest of the country, he said.Meat companies said they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in coronavirus-related safety equipment and extra pay for workers, and that those steps have helped employees feel comfortable about returning to work. Plants installed thermal scanners to identify potentially feverish employees as they walk in to work and have erected plastic partitions between work stations on meat-cutting lines, where employees have often stood shoulder to shoulder for much of their shifts.As infections rise across the country, however, labor officials said workers remain at risk.UNDERSTANDING CORONAVIRUSWhat We Know About the VirusCovid-19 Tests and TreatmentA Guide to State LockdownsWhat Small Businesses Need to Know About the Stimulus“The workers don’t feel that it’s gotten better,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents poultry-plant employees. He estimated that 30% of the union’s meat-plant members continue to stay home from their jobs.Scott Brooks, Tyson’s head of food safety, said cases have been rising among the company’s workers in recent weeks, but at smaller levels than the general population. Some of Tyson’s plants and other facilities haven’t logged any new cases for weeks, he said, and recent tests of plant workers showed that many workers who tested positive didn’t exhibit any symptoms.The Arkansas-based company now is implementing a continuing testing program aimed at better detecting any asymptomatic employees and regularly testing higher-risk workers, such as plant nurses, Mr. Brooks said.A JBS spokesman said that half of its plant workforce has been tested regardless of local infection rates, and in areas where cases are high, more than 80% of employees have been tested. A spokesman for Cargill said the company’s plants are running at 95% of their normal levels and should be back to full production in the next several weeks.The U.S. meatpacking industry, which employs about 585,000 workers, became an early epicenter for infections as the coronavirus spread across the country. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which estimates its members represent about 80% of beef-and-pork processing, said last week that 65 meatpacking workers had died due to the coronavirus and more than 4,000 have been infected.Related VideoFauci Warns Coronavirus Cases Could Reach 100,000 a DayDr. Anthony Fauci told a Senate committee Tuesday that coronavirus cases in the U.S. could “go up to 100,000 a day” if people continue to flout advice on social distancing and face masks. Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg NewsDennis Medbourn, a member of the UFCW union who works at a Tyson pork plant in Logansport, Ind., said that facility has nearly returned to normal production after some of the plant’s 2,200 workers, including him, tested positive for Covid-19 in late April. The plant shut down for over a week.As cases rise again, Mr. Medbourn said, about 10% of the Logansport plant’s employees have continued to stay home. “I believe it’s strictly out of fear,” he said on a conference call hosted by the UFCW last week.Tyson is checking employees’ temperatures daily and testing employees, Mr. Medbourn said. He said that the company still should provide more information to workers about positive cases, and slow down processing lines to allow for better social distancing until a vaccine is available.Hector Gonzalez, Tyson’s head of U.S. human resources, said the company already has slowed lines at plants due to so many workers being out. Tyson has discussed processing speeds with union officials, Mr. Gonzalez said. He added that its other safeguards meet or exceed recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Tyson has held ongoing meetings with the UFCW and employees are steadily returning to work, Mr. Gonzalez said. In some cases, he said, workers are absent because positive tests required them to quarantine, and privacy regulations limit how much specific information the company provides on worker illnesses.Mr. Appelbaum, of the RWDSU, said better information from meatpackers would help employees feel safer about going to work in meat plants. “People need to be tested, otherwise you don’t know if the person next to you is sick or not,” he said.STAY INFORMEDGet a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here.",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-surge-tests-safeguards-for-meatpacking-workers-11593719573
Wall Stree Journal,"The early autumn foliage in the opening shots of “The Truth” could pass for a classic Japanese landscape. And why not, since the film, streaming on demand across major digital platforms, was written and directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, who has given us such masterpieces as “Shoplifters,” “Still Walking,” “Nobody Knows” and “After Life”? But the setting is contemporary Paris, it’s the filmmaker’s first venture in a language not his own, and the object of his intense attention is an aging French movie star, Fabienne Dangeville, played by the peerless Catherine Deneuve (whose middle name is Fabienne). Layer upon layer of movie history enriches a witty disquisition on the slippery nature of truth, and of memory. The occasion is the publication of Fabienne’s memoir and the arrival from New York of her screenwriter daughter, Lumir (Juliette Binoche, at the top of her form), for a reunion that quickly renews old conflicts. This isn’t a great film, but it’s a work of great subtlety with artfully smudged boundaries—“Rashomon” in modern dress and watercolors.MORE FILM REVIEWS‘Zappa’ Review: A Rock Star Savant November 25, 2020‘My Psychedelic Love Story’ Review: Tales of the High Life November 25, 2020‘Jiu Jitsu’ Review: Meta Martial-Arts Melee November 19, 2020‘The Last Vermeer’ Review: The Forger Who Fooled Göring November 19, 2020The true-or-false game is played at its simplest level by Lumir checking her mother’s facts. The blithely fictionalized memoir—which Fabienne has shamelessly titled “The Truth”—says Lumir’s father, Pierre, is dead. He is not, and shows up at the front door as living proof: Roger Van Hool plays him with goofy charm. The book says Fabienne always made a point of picking up Lumir from school. She did not; that was Sarah, Fabienne’s beloved friend, an exceptional actress who came to a tragic end. (Sarah figures prominently, though somewhat murkily, in their conversations. She’s a surrogate for Ms. Deneuve’s older sister, the actress Françoise Dorléac, who died at age 25 in a car crash.)No love is lost between mother and daughter: Fabienne was a flop at parenting and remains unrepentant about it. Repentance has no more place in her nature than humility. At age 73 she’s sometimes unsure which of her rivals remains among the living, but she knows she’s survived with her place in movie history assured, and that’s all she seems to care about: “I prefer to have been a bad mother and a bad friend but a good actress.”Mr. Kore-eda brings a painterly sensibility to all of his films, working the edges as carefully as the center. (The cinematographer was the superb Eric Gautier.) In this one he invents another film, a sci-fi fantasy that Fabienne is currently shooting. It turns on a mother-daughter theme—Fabienne is jealous of the gifted newcomer who plays her daughter—and includes an actor’s dream of agelessness; her character has spent years on another planet where no one gets older.Lumir has her own family tensions to contend with. Her husband, Hank, played with touching good cheer by Ethan Hawke, is a struggling TV actor, precariously on the wagon until Fabienne, who derogates or subverts everyone around her, convinces him to have some wine. (Their preteen daughter, Charlotte, is played by Clémentine Grenier, who must have come from a planet where children who have never been on a movie set radiate unremitting enchantment; the pure delight she takes in everything around her is almost palpable.) And Lumir, who abandoned her ambition to be an actress, has her own fraught relationship with facts. Her memories of her childhood, and of Fabienne’s approach to the maternal arts, may be her truth, but they are, as it develops, only the beginning of a passionate conversation.Juliette Binoche as Lumir, Catherine Deneuve as Fabienne, Ethan Hawke as Hank and Clémentine Grenier as CharlottePHOTO: IFC FILMSOf the film’s many delights, the most conspicuous is its portrait of a star—and celebrity—coming up on the end of her career, if not her life. Fabienne would seem to be impregnable in her fortress of entitlement. She is scornful of the acting Hank does for a living: “It’s an imitation.” Her default expression is faintly acidulous, though her face lights up when Charlotte, her adoring granddaughter, points a snapshot camera her way. Implicit in the riveting spectacle of her self-regard is the question of what’s true or false in any kind of acting. Unfeeling toward those she wounds, she enlists Lumir to help her repair a broken relationship by coming up with a speech of apology that she can then, as she puts it, “interpret”; what’s a screenwriter for?The deeper delight lies in what Ms. Deneuve does with the role Mr. Kore-eda has created for her. She doesn’t make Fabienne lovable, but gallant, vulnerable, very funny and intricately memorable. Watching Fabienne in the fullness of her years means seeing Catherine as the exquisite young wife singing ardently in “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” as the eerily detached housewife/prostitute in “Belle de Jour,” the conflicted actress and theater manager in “The Last Metro” or the elegant plantation owner in “Indochine.” The script is full of references to Ms. Deneuve’s long and distinguished career, and she obviously relishes them, or they wouldn’t be there. Best of all, though, she pulls off the lovely conceit—the master joke—of an impossibly famous movie star playing a version of herself, and doing it with a delicate mix of fondness and self-irony. That constitutes truthtelling of a high order.***Kelly Reichardt’s “First Cow,” set in frontier Oregon circa 1820, opened in limited theatrical release on March 6, was greeted by extraordinarily enthusiastic reviews, and rang up the highest first-weekend box office figures of the filmmaker’s career. I called it “too lovely for words,” and described its hero, Cookie Figowitz, a cook played by John Magaro, as “one of the most touching characters to have graced the screen in a very long time, someone you take instantly to your heart.” Few people were able to see the film, however, because theaters closed down before the beginning of national distribution.

Despite their anxiety, they didn’t want to put their efforts on pause because of the pandemic — even though, with Bordeaux’s hours at Starbucks cut, they can barely afford the $240 monthly insurance premiums. Trish and Derek Bordeaux“I’m going in the hole, but it’s the only way I can keep the insurance,” Trish Bordeaux said. “On top of the money concerns, I’m really worried about getting the virus. But I’ve wanted to be a mom for so long. So long that continuing to work is a risk I’m willing to take.”Many millennials like Trish Bordeaux, who came of age in the shadow of the 2008 financial crisis, have deferred marriage, home-owning and childbearing partly because of economic insecurity. Now, for those who have been deliberating whether to grow their families, the pandemic has layered fresh concerns atop old ones — financial concerns, health concerns and existential ones. A recent survey by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advocates for reproductive rights, found that many young women intend to delay childbearing or have fewer children because of the pandemic. In an analysis of their data for WSJ Noted, the researchers determined that some 45 percent of the 18 to 34-year-old women they surveyed were changing their plans in this regard.“This public health crisis has impacted people’s private lives,” said Laura Lindberg, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advocates for reproductive rights. “It’s a deep disruption to the decision-making process around having a child.” In interviews over the last month, five couples and one single woman described their sometimes agonizing deliberations about whether to start, continue or halt their efforts to have a baby in such a precarious moment.“There’s  a lot of uncertainty right now as more and more news comes out,” said Alicia Alvarez of San Diego. “I have a lot of excitement, but also a lot of anxiety over the unknowns, and the things we can’t control.”Like Alvarez, who is choosing to be a single mother, most of those interviewed for this article are planning to use reproductive technology to get pregnant. This has further complicated their experience, given that many fertility specialists temporarily suspended their practices on the advice of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.THE JOURNAL.The Birthrate Was Already Low. Then the Pandemic Hit.Millennials who graduated into the last recession face lower salaries, are less likely to own their homes and tend to marry later. And now, because of the pandemic, some may decide to delay having children. Allison Pohle, a reporter for WSJ Noted, explains.

The couple, both in their 30s, have a four-year-old son, and want to have another child.But at a consultation in February, they learned that the procedure would cost them $20,000, out of pocket because their insurance wouldn’t cover it. Then, soon afterward, Brent was furloughed from his job as a copier repair technician due to the pandemic.“What’s the right thing for our family?” Katie McDannald, a social worker, asked her husband. “We have this family we want to grow. But we have a family that is here, and that we have to take care of, and keep secure and healthy. And letting go of that $20,000 for a …”Her husband interjected: “A maybe.”She continued: “For a maybe. Yeah.” She added: “Letting go of that $20,000 seems insane and irresponsible.” So the McDannalds have put their plans for more children on hold until they feel safer — “physically, morally and financially,” Katie said.Brian and Izzie Sullivan of Charlotte, N.C., are having a very different kind of conversation. Tech workers who love to travel, the Sullivans have never felt a sense of urgency about expanding their family. “It always seemed like something we would do in the future,” Izzie Sullivan, 30, said. “And the future kept pushing itself outward.”Izzie and Brian SullivanDuring the shutdown, however, with both of them working remotely from home, they’ve reconsidered. “It is kind of putting a fresh perspective on the simplicity of life, of the idea of having more fun at home,” Brian Sullivan, 35, said. “Having a child in that situation actually sounds really attractive.”Still, the U.S. birthrate is at a record low, and the pandemic is expected to depress it even further over the coming years, experts told The Wall Street Journal recently.Many couples are considering delaying pregnancy now out of concern about health risks to the mother and fetus. At this moment, it is considered safe for women to attempt pregnancy, provided they take proper health precautions, said Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.  But there’s still very little data about how Covid-19 affects fetuses or newborns, Dr. Gyamfi-Bannerman said.And just last week, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added pregnant women to its list of people at higher risk of severe coronavirus illness. The new CDC analysis found that pregnant women with Covid-19 are more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit and put on a ventilator than non-pregnant women with the disease.  Andrea and Irving LeónSo couples like Andrea and Irving León, who live in Frederick, Md., have trepidations. They have been trying to have a baby for six years, and Andrea, 26, has suffered eight miscarriages. When the pandemic struck, they were moving forward with in vitro fertilization. But even before their fertility clinic closed, Andrea, who works as a neuro technician, decided to put her treatments on hold. “I work in health care,” she said. “I saw how real this pandemic was hitting and so I decided to kind of back off. We don’t know how it’s going to affect our embryos that we want to create. We don’t know how it’s going to affect pregnancy for me.”In April, they got a close-up look at how scary the coronavirus could be at the same time as they got a taste of parenthood. When Andrea’s best friend was hospitalized with complications from Covid-19, the Leóns took in her five-month-old son. Every time they FaceTimed with Andrea’s friend, they saw her struggling to breathe, and crying out for her baby. After that, while their friend recovered fully, the Leóns felt affirmed in their decision to wait.Alicia AlvarezDeferral is a more difficult decision for women who are older, because conceiving and carrying a child to term becomes more difficult with age, Dr. Gyamfi-Bannerman said. “The decision to wait, for someone who’s maybe 38 — it’s going to be different than for someone who’s 28.”In San Diego, Alvarez, who is 35, does not feel she has time to lose. After miscarrying triplets in 2018, Alvarez froze her eggs, and planned to go to a consultation for in vitro fertilization in March. But her appointment was cancelled when her fertility clinic temporarily closed due to Covid-19 precautions. Her appointment has now been rescheduled for early July, a delay of just a few months, but any delay concerns her, she said. Her doctors have predicted that she will go through early menopause, and she worries about fertility struggles as she gets older.Also, there is no way of knowing how rising coronavirus cases in California will affect her clinic; she is already being channeled into telemedicine, which feels strange “on such a personal journey,” she said. “I don’t know if I’m going to feel great about not having that face to face with my doctor.”Christina and Marissa RomanoAs soon as their clinic reopened in New York, Christina and Marissa Romano pushed forward with their plans. They had been wanting to start a family since before they got married in 2019, but wanted first to get more secure in their finances and their jobs as physician assistants. At the end of 2019, they selected a sperm donor, and anticipated that Christina, 31, would be inseminated in March. That did not happen, but when they were offered a new appointment in mid-May, they grabbed it. “Given my age, I’m just not going to wait a couple of years,” Christina said. Christina is pregnant now, and taking great precautions. Marissa drives Christina from their home in Queens to her job in Manhattan three times a week so she doesn’t have to take public transportation. The backdrop of this intimate moment in their lives is depressing, but the pregnancy animates them.“I think the state of the world, I mean, honestly, I’ve always thought it’s kind of terrible,” Christina said. “But I think that family, for me, gives me a reason to live. And it gives me so much hope.”",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-coronavirus-has-affected-family-planning-11593543743

Wall Stree Journal,"PHOTO: JEFFREY GREENBERG/UNIVERSAL IMAGES GROUP VIA GETTY IMAGESThere is a common theme between the discussions of morality and moral law in Daniel Henninger’s “Smiley Face Liberalism” (Wonder Land, June 25) and “Notable & Quotable: Dr. King” (June 25). Mr. Henninger speaks of the left’s erasure of “even the idea of a functioning consensus about morality,” concluding that in a society untethered to a shared moral baseline, no one today has moral authority. The latter quotes a portion of Martin Luther King Jr.’s powerful and timeless “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” in the context of the recent kerfuffle at UCLA, where lecturer W. Ajax Peris is under investigation for having the temerity to read King’s letter aloud in class, in which King used the n-word twice.One suspects UCLA’s microaggression monitors have little real concern about their exquisitely sensitive students hearing Dr. King’s meaningful, historical use of a word that is heard in almost every gangsta-rap song today. Rather, it is King’s message about the foundation for a moral code that is most threatening to leftist academia’s relativism, i.e., that “just” laws must be rooted in natural law, eternal law or the law of God. As with the writers of our Declaration of Independence, which refers to the “Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God,” King declared there must be a fixed touchstone or standard against which to determine what laws are moral and just, or not. Otherwise, laws can be declared just or unjust arbitrarily, as it suits the ideology of the loudest or most powerful voice in the conversation. One can only wonder how King himself would have fared if he read his letter verbatim today in a class of those offended UCLA students.Ed GrysavageSt. Augustine, Fla.",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/kings-moral-vision-is-a-threat-to-the-woke-11593717917
Wall Stree Journal,"Uta Hagen in ‘Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’PHOTO: ASSOCIATED PRESSWhen Hollywood filmed Broadway hits—something that it used to do as a matter of course—it was all too typically safe to assume that the quality of the screen version would vary in direct proportion to the number of people involved in the adaptation who had also taken part in the original stage production. If the screenplay was knocked out by a studio veteran and none of the actors had previously played their roles onstage, you could almost always smell trouble.That said, there have been certain glorious exceptions to this grim rule of thumb, among them Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” whose fourth Broadway revival was in previews when the coronavirus pandemic struck New York in March. On paper, Mike Nichols’s 1966 film version looked like a disaster in the making. Back then, Nichols was best known as a stand-up comedian turned up-and-coming stage director who had just three Broadway credits to his name, all of them light comedies. He had yet to work on a film in any capacity whatsoever. As for Ernest Lehman, who adapted Albee’s 1962 play, he specialized in comedies, thrillers and the screen adaptations of musicals like “The Sound of Music” and “West Side Story.” Save for “Sweet Smell of Success,” he’d never worked on a film remotely as dark as “Virginia Woolf.”To make matters worse, Warner Bros. gave the brush-off to Arthur Hill, Uta Hagen, George Grizzard and Melinda Dillon, the justly admired stars of the original stage production, and instead cast Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, the world’s most famous movie-star couple, with George Segal and Sandy Dennis, neither of whom had much experience with stage drama, in support. Burton, of course, was a distinguished classical actor, but Taylor had never set foot on a stage, and though she’d appeared in numerous film roles of consequence, it was anyone’s guess whether she was up to the challenge of playing a blowsy, drunken, pitifully unhappy 50-year-old housewife.Yet against all odds, the film version of “Virginia Woolf” proved to be a wholly successful big-screen realization of Albee’s play. Lehman stuck to the script, opening up the action only slightly and going out of his way to preserve the claustrophobic atmosphere of the play, in which two professors and their wives drink themselves into a stupor after a faculty party and start clawing strips off one another, telling home truths that should have been left unspoken—or maybe not.Insisting that the film be shot in black-and-white (unusual for a mid-’60s major-studio release) to give it a harshly documentary look, Nichols solicited and took the advice of Haskell Wexler and Sam O’Steen, his cinematographer and editor, who taught him the difference between directing for stage and screen. He also scheduled a six-week rehearsal period before shooting the film, and it paid off: His cast had the unanimity of a true stage ensemble, with Taylor immersing herself in her part so unselfishly that you would never have guessed that she was a name-above-the-title movie star who was also a legendary beauty.Much to everyone’s surprise, “Virginia Woolf” was a popular success, winning five Oscars, grossing $10.3 million ($82 million in today’s dollars), and making Nichols a hot property on both coasts. Would it have been a hit without the combined star power of Burton and Taylor? Not a chance. But those lucky enough to see the Broadway production, which ran for a year and a half, unanimously regretted that the members of the original cast, directed by Alan Schneider, never got a chance to film their own distinctive performances. Fortunately for posterity, Columbia Records made a studio recording of the entire play four months after opening night. That four-LP set was reissued on CD in 2014 and can also be digitally downloaded. In addition, it has been uploaded to YouTube in its entirety.To hear the original cast of “Virginia Woolf” is by no means to be disappointed in the extraordinary film version. Still, the performances of the stage cast are wholly absorbing in their own way, that of Ms. Hagen in particular. To hear her is to know just what Howard Taubman, who reviewed the play for the New York Times, had in mind when he wrote that “as the vulgar, scornful, desperate Martha, Miss Hagen makes a tormented harridan horrifyingly believable.” Her colleagues are no less convincing, and it is a not-so-minor miracle to be able to hear for yourself how one of the half-dozen greatest American plays of the 20th century was first brought to furious, frightening life on the stage of the Billy Rose Theatre (now the Nederlander Theatre) nearly six decades ago.

Wall Stree Journal,"Minneapolis City HallPHOTO: STEPHEN MATUREN/GETTY IMAGESThe Tom Lyden KMSP-TV “Notable & Quotable” (June 29) exposes the fallacy of Minneapolis scuttling its own police force. Three council members who received “threats” because they wish to defund the Minneapolis Police Department are having taxpayers foot the bill for private security at the tune of $4,500 a day. This is necessary, Mr. Lyden reports, because MPD resources are needed in the community, according to a MPD spokesperson.That’s not a surprising move by the MPD given the people who are asking for protection. And for some odd reason, police are still needed in the community. Are ordinary citizens who receive threats eligible for this type of protection at the expense of fellow taxpayers? Shouldn’t these council members choose therapists and social workers to protect them instead of trained security personnel since this is the “nonpolicing” route they are embarking on?Wouldn’t it be less expensive for Minneapolis to purchase handguns for the council members and train them in concealed-carry protocols so they could protect themselves? If the MPD is disbanded, concealed carry may be the preferred route citizens will need to take since the city won’t provide either private security at $1,500 a day or have police to protect its ordinary citizens.

Wall Stree Journal,"Demonstrators scuffle with police officers in New York, June 14.PHOTO: EDUARDO MUNOZ/REUTERSIn “The Other Police Immunity Problem” (op-ed, June 25), Peter H. Schuck says that there are two injustices regarding police immunity, namely “overprotection of bad cops and excessive barriers to recovery by their victims.” He goes on to say that the police and the public relationship must be repaired but he misses two important other causes of the problem.Inconsistent enforcement of existing statutes at all levels puts the police in impossible situations. Police enforce the law, then the prosecutors, such as New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., say they won’t prosecute those who have broken the law, making the police look like the bad guys for even trying to uphold the law.Of course there are bad cops, just like there are corrupt politicians and even bad professors. The problems aren’t on one side of the equation. The public needs to show the same regard for the police that it wants shown to them. A holistic study is needed, not merely tweaking of a law from 1871 to rein in police as Mr. Schuck would prefer.Larry StewartPonte Vedra Beach, Fla.Prof. Schuck’s proposal to unleash trial lawyers on individual police officers by eliminating qualified immunity is terribly flawed and will exacerbate an already worrisome trend of good cops leaving the profession of law enforcement. His statement that “cops on the beat are the principal actors in situations of injury-inflicting misconduct” is an outrageous slander against the police, the vast majority of whom are good and decent public servants. The inconvenient fact is that most people who are injured by police have resisted arrest or have refused to comply with lawful orders and are often posing a lethal threat to the police or others.Most reasonable people agree that law-enforcement agencies need to do a better job of getting rid of the rare bad cop as well as providing more transparency of police disciplinary actions, but to expose individual officers to possible ruinous civil liability while they are legally performing their very difficult and dangerous jobs will lead to less public safety, more crime and more chaos in our streets.Tom NewmanScottsdale, Ariz.",7/2/2020,https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-immunity-critics-must-consider-this-11593717799

Wall Stree Journal,"Companies are facing added difficulty staying connected to work-from-home employees in remote areas, where internet services can be slow and at times patchy, technology executives and analysts say.Though not new, the problem has become more pressing as the number of Covid-19 cases surges in rural states that had largely been spared the pandemic. The increase has prompted local officials to impose preventive measures that will likely keep employees at businesses headquartered in these regions from returning to the office.“You have some people who have lousy connections at home and there’s nothing you can do,” said Paul Scorza, chief information officer and executive vice president of information technology at supermarket operator Retail Business Services LLC, whose brands include Stop & Shop, Food Lion, Hannaford and other grocery store chains.CONTENT FROM OUR SPONSORDeloitteCIO Insights and Analysis from DeloitteGoogle Cloud: Pandemic Fast-Tracks TransformationTransformation projects can be lengthy ordeals, beginning with an organization’s sometimes painstaking decision to commit to the project.

So far, industry executives and analysts have reported no major outages or service disruptions.But that could change as the coronavirus takes hold in places like Arkansas, Idaho, Montana, Mississippi and other states with large rural populations.A recent state-by-state analysis of download speeds by HighSpeedInternet.com, a website that compares internet service providers, reported speeds below the national average of 59.5 megabits per second in Arkansas, Mississippi, South Dakota, Idaho and Maine, among other states.But internet speeds in some cities and towns in these states fall below the bare minimum for broadband service, which the Federal Communications Commission defines as an internet connection with download speeds of 25 megabits a second or faster.An estimated 10% to 15% of the U.S. population is underserved by broadband providers, said Courtney Munroe, a research vice president at International Data Corp., a world-wide technology research firm. “A lot of this is in rural communities.”Local internet services in these regions tend to be slower, in part because they cover wider distances to reach end users. That can make services more costly and less profitable to providers, said Josh Chessman, a senior director at research firm Gartner Inc.Making matters worse, he added, many households tend to use their internet service provider’s Wi-Fi routers, which aren’t “necessarily the best and fastest.”Add to that multiple devices using the same wireless access point and connection and “you have a huge issue,” Mr. Chessman said.Why 5G Is Fast but Spotty in the U.S.In the global race for 5G, U.S. telecom firms have a unique disadvantage: limited access to the “goldilocks” band of radio frequencies. WSJ explains the science and its implications. Illustration by Carlos Waters/WSJ (Originally published 10/30/19)André Kindness, a principal analyst for infrastructure and operations at Forrester Research, said remote workers in this situation can use email, but they will find “most collaboration tools such as voice over IP to be useless.” A large number of households in rural areas even rely on outdated dial-up services for internet access, he said, and many don’t have 4G coverage to use as a backup.Slow internet connections also limit the speed of real-time file transfers to and from cloud data storage, among other routine business tasks, said Todd Thibodeaux, president and chief executive of CompTIA, the IT trade group. Common workarounds include shifting more work offline with occasional filesynching, he said.Other options can be too costly, such as providing employees with advanced networking hardware or paying for dedicated lines, analysts said.MOREClimate Researchers Enlist Big Cloud Providers for Big Data Challenges November 25, 2020Coronavirus Pandemic Helps Speed More CIOs Toward Business Operations Accountability November 24, 2020DHL’s Warehouse Management Business Makes It Easier to Onboard Robots November 23, 2020Micron Technology Inc., an Idaho-based computer chip maker, in March began taking steps to support remote-work capabilities for roughly 3,500 employees living in and around Boise, said Anand Bahl, the company’s CIO and corporate vice president.The measures included issuing 700 laptops, 800 monitors and 2,900 remote desktop and virtual machine accounts, which enable off-site computers to access the company’s network and applications, Mr. Bahl said in an email.

Wall Stree Journal,"WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court will decide whether Congress can have grand-jury materials from the Mueller probe of Russian election interference, likely delaying any release until after Election Day.The high court in a brief written order Thursday said it would hear an appeal by the Trump administration that is seeking to keep the materials from being released. The justices in May had temporarily blocked congressional access to the grand jury information, a signal the court was likely to take up the case in full.The court isn’t scheduled to hear any new cases until October, so unless the justices make special arrangements to speed up their deliberations, their normal timeline would mean a decision isn’t likely until winter at the earliest.The Mueller report, released in redacted form last year, documented sweeping Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. The special counsel didn’t establish that anyone from the Trump campaign conspired with Russia, though the report cited repeated contacts between Russia-linked entities and Trump campaign officials.Robert Mueller chose not to reach a judgment on whether President Trump illegally interfered with the investigation but said the president’s conduct raised questions. Attorney General William Barr has said President Trump’s actions didn’t amount to obstruction of justice and the president has denied any wrongdoing.The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee sought access to material that was redacted from the report, as well as some of the exhibits and transcripts referenced in it. When the Justice Department declined the request, the committee went to federal court. The committee said material was important for determining whether President Trump committed an impeachable offense in the course of the probe.The Judiciary Committee in papers filed with the high court argued the Justice Department was making a novel and unsupportable effort to deny the legislative branch the evidence it needed to fulfill its constitutional duties.“I am disappointed by the court’s decision to prolong this case further, but I am confident we will prevail,” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), the committee chairman. “In every administration before this one, DOJ has cooperated with the Judiciary Committee’s requests for grand-jury materials relating to investigations of impeachable offenses.”Mr. Nadler said Messrs. Trump and Barr “are continuing to try to run out the clock on any and all accountability.”The Justice Department argued that grand-jury secrecy must be assured for witnesses to come forward and testify fully. It also said the committee shouldn’t be able to access the material by simply asserting it might be relevant to “a hypothetical future impeachment.”“We are pleased the Supreme Court is hearing the case,” a department spokeswoman said. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.Both a federal trial judge and an appeals court ruled the committee could have the material. Grand-jury records are usually secret, but the lower courts said an impeachment probe fell under an exception to that rule.The Supreme Court will review those rulings.From the ArchivesThe Legal Logic of the Mueller ReportSpecial counsel Robert Mueller’s report found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. The question of obstruction proved more challenging. WSJ’s Ashby Jones analyzes the legal underpinnings of the report.
