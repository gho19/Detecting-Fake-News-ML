New York Times,"It was an exercise in contrast, a tableau of multimillion-dollar apartments, sticky barbecue sauce and lemon-scented towelettes.On West 72nd Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, an elegant boulevard that tumbles out of the park, the buildings have names like the Majestic and the Hermitage. On the corner, the late Lauren Bacall’s three-bedroom apartment at the Dakota, one of the most storied apartment houses in Manhattan, is for sale for $26 million. Every day, a burbling stream of tourists meanders along the sidewalk, snapping pictures of the splendor.And when they got thirsty, those out-of-towners, and more than a few in-towners, would stop at the Dallas BBQ restaurant in the middle of the block, perhaps to buy a boozy, frozen drink called the Pineapple Crush for $6.99. (An extra shot, plopped in the glass in what looked like a test tube, cost $2.) A drink called the Bulldog, with a miniature Corona in the slush, was also available.ImageLarge plates of ribs, chicken and other barbecue fare and oversize drinks were the main attractions at the original Dallas BBQ restaurant, on West 72nd Street.Credit...Damon Winter/The New York TimesFor more than 30 years, the Dallas BBQ on 72nd Street served up cheap ribs and liquor on what was, increasingly, a rarefied block. The location was the first of what became a small family empire of about a dozen restaurants across New York City. At 9 p.m. Wednesday, that incongruous era ended: The original Dallas BBQ slung its last frozen daiquiri and closed its doors forever.The main reason for the closing was familiar: a rent increase. And while many people look at that block of 72nd Street and see glamour and grandeur, Stuart Wetanson, 25, whose family owns the Dallas BBQ chain, also sees what it lacks.""We look to be close to a major subway hub, close to major business areas, commercial districts, movie theaters, hospitals, schools,” he said. “All the things West 72nd Street is missing.”ImageStuart Wetanson, whose family began serving inexpensive food and drinks at the first Dallas BBQ, on 72nd Street, more than 30 years ago, outside the chain’s Times Square location.Credit...Damon Winter/The New York TimesThere were other limitations. Outside the chain’s restaurant in Times Square, a rotating red and blue “BBQ” sign, about the size of a full-grown person, announces its presence. On West 72nd Street, small navy awnings mark the spot. The block lies within a historic district, where signage must be approved by the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission. When asked if the commission would be likely to approve a person-size rotating BBQ sign on West 72nd Street, a spokeswoman for the panel laughed.Mr. Wetanson’s grandfather Herb Wetanson opened a restaurant at 27 West 72nd Street in 1978 that the family describes as a franchise of Swiss Chalet, a Canadian rotisserie chicken chain. (Certain details of the current décor, like patches of faux exposed brick, leave the impression that you are munching on dinner in the dungeon of a castle.) Within about two years, the elder Mr. Wetanson started to add ribs and other barbecue fare. On a recent Monday night, the 300-seat space was more than half full by 6:45. A young woman seated at the bar, who said she worked at a nearby Banana Republic, declared herself heartbroken that the restaurant was closing because it was the only decent place in the area to get a cheap drink. To go with that drink, she recommended the Hennessy Burger, which was served with bacon, Cheddar cheese and a gooey, reddish sauce.ImageThe exterior of the original Dallas BBQ restaurant, on West 72nd Street, on Tuesday. Noise from crowds outside the entrance would sometimes annoy neighbors.Credit...Damon Winter/The New York TimesDallas BBQ mostly had a peaceful relationship with its neighbors, though there were occasional kerfuffles. In the mid-1990s, an anonymous flier posted around the neighborhood urged people to complain to local politicians about the crowds that gathered outside the restaurant and the noise they created. Scott M. Stringer, now the city comptroller but a state assemblyman at the time, got involved, and a weekend doorman was hired.Some neighbors continued to complain about the buses filled with student or sightseeing groups that idled outside, and the crowds that could make it difficult to pass on the sidewalk. In the past dozen years, the city’s 311 line for questions and complaints would get calls about excessive noise from time to time.June Rousso, who has lived next door for 30 years, said that every so often, someone at a co-op board meeting would say, “Oh, I hope that lease is coming up soon.”Wish granted. Mr. Wetanson said workers at 72nd Street would all get jobs at other locations. He also said he hoped to find a new West Side site on a more heavily traveled block, maybe near Columbus Circle or 125th Street — and not one where signs need landmark commission approval.",2015-01-01T00:28:46+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/nyregion/long-out-of-place-on-an-exclusive-manhattan-block-a-restaurant-moves-out.html,733,15
New York Times,"The aural offenses of the New York City subway are legion. Trains screech. Announcements drone on. Panhandlers’ performances lurch off key.But for nearly a decade, a singular squawk has bedeviled riders with particular insistence: the emergency exit siren, publicly shaming — or perhaps celebrating — travelers who did not care to wade into common turnstile traffic.Now it will blare no more. In an acknowledgment that the alarms had done little to discourage fare evasion as intended, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said on Wednesday that it was disabling them at all of its stations.“We gave it a shot,” said Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the authority, which had already removed alarms from sites with station agents.Since its introduction around 2006, the siren system had its disadvantages. Here were roughly 1,400 emergency alarms that rarely signaled an emergency, the alerts more likely to be set off by a rolling stroller than a renegade fare-beater.And the doors tantalized, often supplying the quickest route in a city that values velocity as no other does.On Wednesday, it seemed the authority would not go so far as to condone all exits through the emergency gates.The authority said it is still technically against the law to use those exits except in emergencies, as past information campaigns have reminded riders. But travelers appear to have wide latitude: The authority has not discouraged the use of emergency gates to exit when stations are overcrowded, a typical symptom of record ridership in recent years.An informal survey of riders, transit experts, a one-time mayoral candidate and a kindly station agent on the Seventh Avenue Line suggested that the authority’s alarm purge would be broadly applauded.“Does the alarm do anything?” asked Beth Onofry, waiting for a train at 23rd Street.“These are universally despised,” said Gene Russianoff of the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group.“We’re New Yorkers,” reasoned Joseph J. Lhota, the former authority chairman and the 2013 Republican nominee for mayor. “Patience is not one of our traits.”Accordingly, the gates have long spawned a daily underground morality play of sorts.WNYC, which reported the demise of the alarms early on Wednesday, identified three approaches to the emergency subway exit in a  2009 segment. There were the “trailblazers,” who pushed through without a second thought; the “pragmatists,” disinclined to set off the alarm but willing to slip through an already open gate; and the “moralists,” who frowned upon overzealous gate use of any sort.Across the system on Wednesday, though, it seemed clear that another breed, the common fare-beater, still lurked.With a station agent tending to a line of travelers at West 96th Street, a rider slid through a gate, a few steps away, without paying.“Alarm will sound,” a panel on the exit read. It did not.Riders appeared split on whether the alarms had not deterred but rather aided fare-beaters through the years, by informing potential scofflaws that the gates were open.Althea Graham, on the platform of the uptown No. 1 train at West 79th Street, feared the absence of sirens would hamstring passengers during a true emergency. “The baby carriages could be stuck or something,” she said.But at 23rd Street later, a haggard family had little trouble navigating the gate. As departing riders pressed open the exit, a woman, bounding down the steps from Broadway shoved through with a stroller and two children in tow.They reached the train before the doors closed, no MetroCard required.",2015-01-01T01:09:26+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/nyregion/exit-alarms-in-the-subways-are-silenced-by-the-mta.html,581,15
New York Times,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Wednesday that he had pardoned two men, saying that each deserved “a second chance without fear of being separated from their families through deportation.”In granting the pardons, Mr. Cuomo was exercising his clemency powers for the second time since he took office in 2011; he issued three pardons in 2013.One of the men pardoned on Wednesday was Antonio Argibay, 62, a longtime architect in New York who said in a phone interview that he had been convicted in a drug case in the mid-1970s and had served about 42 months in prison. Mr. Argibay, who is from Cuba and now lives in Montclair, N.J., earned a master’s degree from the Pratt Institute in 1980 while under parole supervision, the governor’s office said.“I’m very emotional right now,” said Mr. Argibay, a permanent resident of the United States who runs his own architectural firm in Manhattan. “I’ve been seeking redemption for 39 years.”The second pardon went to Alvaro Khalil Cumberbatch, 33, of Springfield Gardens, Queens, who was convicted of first-degree robbery in 2003 and was released from prison in 2010, the governor’s office said. He currently works with organizations that help former convicts re-enter society, including the Fortune Society, and owns a social media consulting business, the governor’s office added.Mr. Cumberbatch declined an interview request made through the governor’s office. But JoAnne Page, the president and chief executive of the Fortune Society, said that her organization had worked with his lawyers in seeking the pardon, and that he had wide support in the community. She called Mr. Cumberbatch a “poster child for what really good work in re-entry looks like.”“He just did so much that you hope people would do against the usual odds, everything from working a job, building a consulting business, being there for his family, helping other people,” she said, adding that Mr. Cumberbatch, who came to this country from Guyana as a child, was taken into custody by federal immigration authorities last year, and released in October.The governor, in his statement, said that “the positive contributions to society by both of these individuals in the years since their release support the case for justice to be delivered through clemency.”Mr. Cuomo’s office said that clemency applications had fallen sharply in recent years, to 171 in 2014 from 1,269 in 2010. The governor’s office also announced the creation of a new website, ny.gov/clemency, as a resource for clemency applicants.",2015-01-01T01:17:38+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/nyregion/cuomo-using-pardon-power-gives-pair-a-second-chance.html,413,16
New York Times,"BATON ROUGE, La. — David Duke seems a figure from the past, the former Klansman and white supremacist who two decades ago was almost elected Louisiana governor.But this week when Representative Steve Scalise, the third-ranking House Republican leader, found himself trying to explain why he accepted a speaking engagement offered by a key aide to Mr. Duke in 2002, it was a reminder of the awkward dance and hard choices that Republicans in Louisiana faced in the 1990s when Mr. Duke was one of the most charismatic politicians in the state.In his 1991 campaign for governor against Edwin W. Edwards, Mr. Duke largely avoided explicitly racial campaigning, appealed to the frustrations and resentments of white voters and won more than 60 percent of the white vote while losing in a runoff election. Two decades later, much of his campaign has merged with the political mainstream here, and rather than a bad memory from the past, Mr. Duke remains a window into some of the murkier currents in the state’s politics where Republicans have sought and eventually won Mr. Duke’s voters, while turning their back on him.Echoing what mainstream Republicans did during the 1991 race for governor and since then, Mr. Scalise quickly distanced himself from Mr. Duke. Mr. Scalise said he only vaguely recalled his speech, had no forewarning it was a white nationalist group and would have avoided the meeting had he known. Still, Roy Fletcher, a Baton Rouge-based political consultant who has managed campaigns for Republicans like former Gov. Mike Foster and Senator John McCain, said Mr. Duke may have become a toxic political personality, but he foreshadowed the state’s coming political and ideological shift.“Now he doesn’t matter anymore,” Mr. Fletcher said. “But politicians here have still co-opted part of his message without having the same baggage.”Louisiana, like most of the South, has become solidly Republican in a way it was not then, and race remains a fluid issue. The current governor, Bobby Jindal, is a conservative Republican of Indian descent whom Mr. Scalise supported. Mr. Duke, 64, who now calls himself a “human rights activist,” continues to sell books, a newsletter, DVDs, art and apparel and to speak on racial and cultural issues. He regularly tells audiences he is not a white supremacist and “condemns any form of racial supremacism and oppression.” But he rails against “the ultimate racists, the Jewish, Zionist tribalists.” During the 1991 race for governor, Mr. Duke attempted to build a bridge between the Klansman he was and the polished politician he wanted to be. He told voters he regretted being “too intolerant” in his youth and said he would not disown his daughters if they brought home an African-American or Jewish boyfriend. Instead, he focused on anti-big government and anti-tax mantras that preceded the Tea Party movement. His decision to run to the right of the field is now a common maneuver in Louisiana’s open primary system.Mr. Duke supported forcing welfare recipients to take birth control. Now there are near-perennial attempts by members of the Louisiana Legislature to give welfare recipients drug tests.After being elected to the state House of Representatives in 1989, Mr. Duke filed nine bills, including measures implementing stricter guidelines for residents of public housing, repealing affirmative action programs and eliminating minority set-asides. Stephanie Grace, a Louisiana political reporter and columnist for the past 20 years, first with The Times-Picayune in New Orleans and now The Advocate of Baton Rouge, recalled her first meeting with Mr. Scalise.ImageRepresentative Steve Scalise, the third-ranking House Republican leader, is under fire for a 2002 speech to a white nationalist group.Credit...Stephen Crowley/The New York Times“He was explaining his politics and we were in this getting-to-know-each-other stage,” Ms. Grace said. “He told me he was like David Duke without the baggage. I think he meant he supported the same policy ideas as David Duke, but he wasn’t David Duke, that he didn’t have the same feelings about certain people as David Duke did.”Mr. Scalise, his Washington staff and political consultant did not respond to emails, texts and phone calls over the past two days. Mr. Duke did not respond to an email sent through his website. But Chuck Kleckley, the Republican speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, said Mr. Scalise’s conservative values should not be confused with Mr. Duke’s personal statements and actions. “It’s not fair to Steve at all,” Mr. Kleckley said. “He’s a good man, a good father, a good husband and a great person. Ever since I’ve known Steve, he wanted to do what’s right for Louisiana. I never felt like there was any kind of David Duke leanings with Steve.” Jason Doré, the executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, said Mr. Duke put it in the awkward position of campaigning for Mr. Edwards, who was later indicted on federal racketeering charges. The slogan, “Vote For the Crook: It’s Important,” caught on like wildfire in 1991. But he rejected the notion that Mr. Duke was somehow the architect of the state’s modern conservative politics.“A lot of these things the conservative movement had supported, like limited government and a stronger defense, since Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckley,” Mr. Doré said. “We already supported a safety net over an entitlement mentality. David Duke did not invent this. He probably co-opted it.”But if Mr. Duke became a third rail for Louisiana Republicans, some Republicans have seen value in courting Mr. Duke’s voters. When he successfully ran for Louisiana governor in 1995, Mr. Foster paid $150,000 for a list of Mr. Duke’s supporters and received his endorsement during the campaign. Mr. Foster said he never used the list, but it did result in a grand jury investigation and an ethics fine for the former governor after the expenditure was not properly reported.And despite Mr. Scalise’s own statement on his speech to Mr. Duke’s European Unity and Rights Organization in 2002, its circumstances remain unclear. Kenny Knight, an organizer for the group and a close associate of Mr. Duke’s, said that he invited Mr. Scalise to speak that day, but to a local group, not the full conference. But Corey Ortis, who was a Louisiana representative for the organization from 2000 to 2004, said he attended the 2002 conference to hear from leaders of their movement, not Mr. Scalise. Still, from what he recalls of the event, Mr. Scalise gave a 10-to-15-minute presentation that was “the typical mainstream Republican thing” and not “too far right.”“He touched on how America was founded on Christian principles, Christian men who founded this country, and how it was believed it would go forward as a Christian nation and how we’re getting away from that,” Mr. Ortis said.Louisiana political experts say the demography of the state’s electorate has played as much of a role, if not larger, as Mr. Duke’s policy ideas in turning Louisiana solidly Republican. Pollster and data analyst John M. Couvillon, the president of JMC Enterprises of Louisiana, said a polarization has taken place to create a black-majority Democratic Party and a solidly white Republican Party.He said the recent open primary election between the incumbent Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, and Congressman Bill Cassidy, a Republican who won the seat, is proof enough. Landrieu carried only 18 percent of the white vote and Cassidy captured just 5 percent of the black vote, Mr. Couvillon said. In concert with the 225,000 white Democrats who have left the party over the past 10 years, he said it has become very difficult for Democrats to win statewide in Louisiana without significant white support.Still, he said, Republicans cannot rely on being an all-white party. “That’s the politics of division, which David Duke was good at it,” Mr. Couvillon said, “but it would be a foolish strategy if Louisiana Republicans were to espouse those same principles David Duke did. That’s a legacy best left behind.”",2015-01-01T01:36:18+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/us/politics/much-of-david-dukes-91-campaign-is-now-in-louisiana-mainstream.html,1293,12
New York Times,"STUTTGART, Germany — Soon after the Islamist group Boko Haram kidnapped nearly 300 teenage girls in Nigeria in April, the United States sent surveillance drones and about 30 intelligence and security experts to help the Nigerian military try to rescue them. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, the top general for American missions in Africa, rushed from his headquarters here to help the commanders in the crisis.Seven months later, the drone flights have dwindled, many of the advisers have gone home and not one of the kidnapped girls has been found. Many are believed to have been married off to Boko Haram fighters, who in the past six months have seized hundreds more civilians, including children, planted bombs in Nigerian cities and captured entire towns.In Washington, that fleeting moment of cooperation between Nigeria and the United States in May has now devolved into finger-pointing and stoked the distrust between the two countries’ militaries. Nigeria’s ambassador to the United States has accused the Obama administration of failing to support the fight against Boko Haram, prompting the State Department to fire back with condemnations of the Nigerian military’s dismal human rights record.“Tensions in the U.S.-Nigeria relationship are probably at their highest level in the past decade,” Johnnie Carson, the State Department’s former top diplomat for Africa, said in an interview. “There is a high degree of frustration on both sides. But this frustration should not be allowed to spin out of control.”Here in Stuttgart, officials at the headquarters of United States Africa Command offered their own bleak assessment of a corruption-plagued, poorly equipped Nigerian military that is “in tatters” as it confronts an enemy that now controls about 20 percent of the country.ImageGen. David M. Rodriguez is the top general for American missions in Africa.Credit...Ted S. Warren/Associated Press“Ounce for ounce, Boko Haram is equal to if not better than the Nigerian military,” said one American official here, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational reports.The violence is in the meantime spilling into neighboring countries like Cameroon, which carried out its first airstrikes against Boko Haram this week, after militants overran a military base and attacked five villages there. Despite Boko Haram’s advances, United States Embassy officials in Abuja said Nigeria had canceled the last stage of American training of a newly created Nigerian Army battalion.The United States’ original effort to help locate and rescue the girls produced scant results, American and Nigerian officials said, in part because of distrust. Although the United States reached an agreement with Nigeria last spring to share some intelligence, American officials did not include raw intelligence data because they believe that Boko Haram has infiltrated the Nigerian security services.The United States has flown several hundred surveillance drone flights over the vast, densely forested regions in the northeast where the girls were seized, but officials in Stuttgart said that with few tips to guide the missions, the flights yielded little information, while diverting drones from other missions in war zones like Iraq and Syria.When the Pentagon did come up with what it calls “actionable intelligence” from the drone flights — for example, information that might have indicated the location of some of the girls — and turned it over to the Nigerian commanders to pursue, they did nothing with the information, Africa Command officials said.In addition, United States security assistance to Nigeria has been sharply limited by American legal prohibitions against close dealings with foreign militaries that have engaged in human rights abuses. Boko Haram: The Other Islamic StateMaps showing the violent rise of the Islamist militant group that is waging a campaign of terror in Nigeria.Last summer, the United States blocked the sale of American-made Cobra attack helicopters to Nigeria from Israel, amid concerns in Washington about Nigeria’s ability to use and maintain that type of helicopter in its effort against Boko Haram, and continuing worries about Nigeria’s protection of civilians when conducting military operations.Those restrictions have drawn sharp criticism from Nigerian officials. In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York in November, Nigeria’s ambassador to the United States, Adebowale Ibidapo Adefuye, said his government was dissatisfied with the “scope, nature and content” of American support in the fight against Boko Haram. He also disputed allegations of human rights violations committed by Nigerian soldiers.“We find it difficult to understand how and why in spite of the U.S. presence in Nigeria with their sophisticated military technology, Boko Haram should be expanding and becoming more deadly,” he said.Mr. Adefuye accused Washington of failing to provide the lethal weapons needed to defeat Boko Haram. In June, the Pentagon gave Nigeria some Toyota trucks, communications equipment and body armor. “There is no use giving us the type of support that enables us to deliver light jabs to the terrorists when what we need to give them is the killer punch,” the ambassador said.Mr. Adefuye’s speech prompted a strong response from the State Department the next day. “We continue to urge Nigeria to investigate allegations of abuses perpetrated by Nigerian security forces, as well as offer Nigeria assistance in developing the doctrine and training needed to improve the military’s effectiveness,” Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters in Washington. “We wouldn’t be raising that concern if we didn’t feel and others didn’t feel that they were warranted.”Groups like Human Rights Watch say the Nigerian military has at times burned hundreds of homes and committed other abuses as it battled Boko Haram and its presumed supporters.VideoIn Nigeria, more than 200 schoolgirls have been held captive since last April.

When Maj. Gen. James B. Linder, the head of American Special Operations forces in Africa, visited Nigeria in late October, he was barred from visiting the base where American trainers were instructing the new Nigerian Army battalion created to help fight Boko Haram. General Linder was left waiting at the gate in what some American officials viewed as another dig at the Pentagon. Africa Command officials insisted it was a “coordination issue that was remedied with a meeting later in the day.“We continue to engage with Nigeria on a broad range of training, equipping, and information-sharing projects across all of the military services,” Benjamin Benson, an Africa Command spokesman, said in an email.Secretary of State John Kerry called Nigeria’s president, Goodluck Jonathan, on Tuesday in part to discuss Boko Haram.The strains between the two militaries are not new, and with Nigeria preparing for national elections in February, American officials fear that earlier assessments may overtake their cautious optimism from the spring.Testifying before House and Senate hearings, administration officials in May offered an unusually candid criticism of the Nigerian military. “We’re now looking at a military force that’s, quite frankly, becoming afraid to even engage,” said Alice Friend, the Pentagon’s principal director for African affairs at the time.Sarah Sewall, the undersecretary of state for civilian security, democracy and human rights, said at a separate hearing that despite Nigeria’s $5.8 billion security budget for 2014, “corruption prevents supplies as basic as bullets and transport vehicles from reaching the front lines of the struggle against Boko Haram.”",2015-01-01T01:39:10+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/with-schoolgirls-still-missing-fragile-us-nigeria-ties-falter.html,1152,1
New York Times,"Word from police officials came quickly: The targeted killings of two New York City police officers meant that officers on foot patrols must walk only in pairs, and uniformed sentries would now guard each precinct station house.They were new orders to a force that was already racking up overtime covering demonstrations. But William J. Bratton, the police commissioner, assured reporters that there would be no letdown in enforcement.Then the latest official statistics came in.Arrests for crimes large and small, as well as tickets for minor infractions, are down drastically across the city. The department has not said whether it believes that officers are acting in concert — as a result of a specific job action — or whether the officers’ deaths produced a spontaneous response.The two precincts most directly affected by the deaths — the 79th, where Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down as they sat in their patrol car on a Brooklyn street; and the 84th, where they were usually assigned — saw a single criminal summons in the week that ended Sunday, according to Police Department statistics. Officers in those precincts wrote no parking or traffic tickets. By contrast, the combined tally of criminal summonses alone during the same week last year reached 130, the department statistics showed.Mr. Bratton said on Monday that a “weeklong period of mourning” and demonstrations that were straining resources were contributing to the drop-off in arrests and summonses. But he said the slowdown should not concern New Yorkers. “I would point out it has not had an impact on the city’s safety at all,” Mr. Bratton said.A top union official flatly denied that there was a job action and pointed to the orders to double up and the need to police demonstrations as the main reasons.“No one has sanctioned a slowdown or stoppage,” said Edward Mullins, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association. “That is not something that anybody came out and said to do.”He added: “We have demonstrations every night of the week, to which cops are being pulled into every night. We have had two officers killed that has changed the everyday duties of what we are doing, and one of those changes is the consistency of patrol cars backing each other up on radio assignments.”He said summonses were simply not a priority at moments like this.Still, one senior police official who reviewed precinct-level data across the city said the decline had the signs of an organized effort and was continuing this week.It is not uncommon for a grieving station house to ease up on enforcement for a brief period. Enforcement numbers can fluctuate from station house to station house, and from week to week, for a number of other reasons, too, including shifts in personnel or directives from commanders. The holidays can also be a factor.But the drop-off in activity in Bedford-Stuyvesant and in Downtown Brooklyn could not explain the sharp slowdown in routine enforcement in each of the city’s 77 police precincts, from the 120th in Staten Island to the 47th in the Bronx.In the week after Officers Ramos and Liu were killed on Dec. 20, the number of summonses for minor criminal offenses, as well as those for parking and traffic violations, decreased by more than 90 percent versus the same week a year earlier. And arrests over seven major categories of felony offenses were nearly 40 percent lower, the numbers show.“Police do have some discretion, and sometimes they use it in waves,” said Dennis C. Smith, a professor of public policy at New York University, who has studied Operation Impact, one of the department’s signature initiatives.Michael J. Palladino, the head of the Detectives’ Endowment Association, said that while a stoppage was not sanctioned for detectives, in his opinion it was understandable.“Cops have feelings, too,” he said. “Now they are the targets of execution. That’s enough to make anyone hesitate, regardless of your profession.”On New Year’s Eve, officers mustering in the lobby of The New York Times before taking up posts in Times Square were told to stay alert and poised.“There are people out there who don’t like us,” one supervisor told the mix of veteran officers and ones minted only on Monday. They then had a moment of silence for Officers Ramos and Liu, who, another supervisor said, “would want us to be professional.”Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans on Wednesday to name streets in Brooklyn after the officers.Those who oppose the department’s use of aggressive policing for minor crimes found themselves applauding the drop in summonses.“Ironically, this is the kind of thing we’re calling for,” said Robert Gangi, the director of the Police Reform Organizing Project. “It’s officers deciding on their own to, in effect, scale back on the application of broken-windows policing.”This year, the Police Department was on pace to record fewer arrests. Through Sunday, overall arrests fell to 387,461 this year, from 392,740 in the same period in 2013, a 1.3 percent decline.Within that, though, officers made more arrests for serious felonies.Through Sunday, felony arrests totaled 42,849, a 4 percent increase over the 41,144 felony arrests in the same period last year.Police officials have stressed that resources, usually deployed to fight crime, have been depleted because of protests since Dec. 3, when a grand jury declined to charge an officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner.The officials said that as many as 2,000 officers a day were being assigned, or put on standby, to monitor the demonstrations.",2015-01-01T01:41:54+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/nyregion/arrest-statistics-decline-sharply-police-unions-deny-an-organized-slowdown.html,933,17
New York Times,"BERLIN — Although she is still popular at home and respected abroad, Chancellor Angela Merkel is entering 2015 facing fresh challenges in both arenas.Greece’s crisis threatens once more to undermine the euro and exacerbate tensions between Berlin and the European Central Bank. In Germany itself, her response to the rise of anti-immigration protests has produced a rare attack from within the chancellor’s conservative camp, and posed the perennial question about how best to confront any sentiment on the far right.Might her 10th year in power be the year Ms. Merkel loses her touch?As one year melted into another, Ms. Merkel showed her hand with an unusually direct riposte to anti-immigrant protesters in Dresden, whose ranks swelled to 17,500 last month. Don’t go to these marches, she warned Germans in her New Year’s address, because the organizers have “prejudice, coldness and even hatred in their hearts.”That challenge will make next Monday’s scheduled protest in Dresden a test of whether Germans heed her call. She won re-election as leader of her Christian Democratic Union with 97.7 percent of the vote at a national party congress in December, but political scientists and some in her own camp assert that she is losing touch with popular sentiment.Outside Germany, whether dealing with the euro crisis or facing down President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over Ukraine, Ms. Merkel has proved patient and determined, sticking to austerity, for instance, despite clamor from markets and other European leaders for a change of direction.But dangers lurk even there. The crisis in Greece may prove more awkward this time around. Polls suggest that the winner of the snap election there on Jan. 25 could be the leftist Alexis Tsipras, who has pledged to ease social misery by renegotiating the terms of the country’s financial rescue package. For Berlin, that means at best a long haggle over a costly new deal; at worst, a rift with the Central Bank and its chief, Mario Draghi, and liability for Greece’s unpaid debts.In 2012, it was Mr. Draghi’s pledge to do “whatever it takes” that crucially supported the euro. Now, Round 2 of the euro crisis looms with Mr. Draghi already at odds with Berlin over his widely predicted plan to purchase government bonds as the bank tries to revive Europe’s economy.In Germany, any new money for Greece would be a hard sell to taxpayers “who still think that those ‘lazy people’ in Greece, Spain, Italy” fritter away hard-earned cash from Northern Europe, said Gero Neugebauer, a political science professor at Berlin’s Free University. The Draghi plan, though not specific to Greece, is unpopular for much the same reason.Michael Fuchs, a senior member of Ms. Merkel’s party, warned on Wednesday that “the times when we had to rescue Greece are over.”Potentially, the biggest challenge comes from the Alternative for Germany, a new populist party founded in 2013 on an anti-euro platform. Its leaders now threaten to unite that message with rising anti-foreigner sentiment. The platform won them seats in three state legislatures in eastern Germany this fall.Ms. Merkel disdains the party in public, not even mentioning it in a long speech to her party congress. But last weekend, a former minister in her cabinet broke ranks. Ms. Merkel may be hugely popular now, Hans-Peter Friedrich, the former minister, told the newsmagazine Der Spiegel, but she has made a “disastrous mistake” in shifting her party left, leaving a vacuum on the right that he warned could spell “mortal danger” for established conservatives.This criticism reeked for some of sour grapes. Mr. Friedrich, while still a senior member of Ms. Merkel’s conservative bloc, was ousted as agriculture minister last February over a complex possible breach of confidence that left him smarting.But it went to the heart of a long-simmering question about whether Ms. Merkel, famous for her tactical skills but accused by critics of lacking strategic vision, would remain popular if times turned worse in what is Europe’s No. 1 economy.“Turning a blind eye and staying silent is not working,” wrote the influential center-right Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel after Mr. Friedrich’s outburst. “Angela Merkel owes her party — and the public — a few answers.”Mr. Friedrich’s warnings contain “much more than a score to settle with Angela Merkel,” said Werner J. Patzelt, a political science professor at the Technical University in Dresden.Watching the anti-immigrant demonstrations from close up, Mr. Patzelt sees a danger that Germany’s political leaders — who, like Ms. Merkel, support asylum for war refugees and luring immigrants needed for Germany’s work force — are losing touch with ordinary people.Almost 50 percent of voters in Saxony did not participate in its Aug. 31 state elections, he noted. “A large share is really people who have grown apart from the political system,” he said. The establishment may have “clear rules about what one can say, or not,” Mr. Patzelt said. “But what the people really think is in large part something else.”Ms. Merkel’s party congress delivered little on security, immigration or refugees, said Karl-Rudolf Korte, a professor at Duisburg-Essen University. On these issues, he told Deutschlandfunk radio, the Alternative for Germany “is often the voice of the silent majority.”Mr. Friedrich openly courted anti-foreigner sentiment, criticizing particularly the decision to grant dual citizenship to children born here of foreign parents — a policy pushed on Ms. Merkel by the center-left Social Democrats in her “grand coalition” government.“This easy attitude to citizenship is wrong, coming precisely when people are questioning their cultural identity, their home and togetherness,” he told Der Spiegel. “Germany is not just any old piece of land, settled more or less by chance by all kinds of people from all kinds of cultures.”Ms. Merkel countered in her New Year’s remarks by extolling the virtues of “sticking together” in tough times. Proof that this works, she said, is Germany’s soccer squad, which won the World Cup in 2014 while featuring several players of foreign origin.But Alexander Gauland, a leader of the Alternative for Germany, and so far the only German politician of some note to have attended a Dresden rally, immediately signaled that she had a fight on her hands.By urging Germans to boycott the Dresden marches, he said, “she is condemning from on high people she doesn’t know at all.”",2015-01-01T01:56:30+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/euro-and-immigration-promise-challenges-for-merkel-in-2015.html,1057,8

New York Times,"Lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the defendant in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, made a last-ditch effort late Wednesday to move the trial out of Boston. In a 32-page filing, they asked a federal appeals court to grant a change of venue, or at a minimum to order the trial judge, George A. O’Toole Jr., to hold a hearing on moving the trial. They also asked Judge O’Toole to delay the start of jury selection, which is scheduled for Monday, while the appeals court considers its request. Judge O’Toole has twice denied the request, most recently earlier Wednesday, saying the jury selection process could find impartial jurors. But Mr. Tsarnaev’s lawyers insisted that would be impossible, arguing that virtually everyone in the Boston region has a connection to the marathon and is, “in effect, an actual victim.” Government prosecutors have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond.

New York Times,"Ben Ammi Ben-Israel, a former Chicago metal worker who led a migration of hundreds of fellow black Americans to what they consider their ancestral homeland, Israel, died on Saturday in a hospital in Beersheba, Israel. He was 75.His organization, the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, announced his death on its website. The cause was not disclosed. To his followers, who called him the father or the holy father, Mr. Ben-Israel was a prophet-like figure who maintained that he had a vision in 1966 in which the angel Gabriel told him to lead an exodus of black Americans to Israel. Since the first African Hebrews arrived there in 1969, the community has grown to about 3,000 members, half of whom were born in Israel. Most live in the city of Dimona, at the edge of the Negev Desert in Israel, and two nearby towns. “We were returning to be reconciled with the Creator,” Mr. Ben-Israel said in a 2008 interview with WBEZ, a public radio station in Chicago.The African Hebrews, like many black Americans in a wider movement that sprang up in the early 1900s, believe that their ancestors were biblical Israelites, members of the tribe of Judah who dispersed to West Africa after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Generations later, they say, descendants of those Israelites were taken to America as slaves.Under Israel’s Law of Return, any Jew can live there and become a citizen. But the African Hebrews do not consider themselves Jews and refuse to convert. “That is our tribal origin,” said Ahmadiel Ben-Yehuda, a spokesman. “We’re not adherents to the religion of Judaism.”For decades, Israelis regarded the African Hebrews as a strange and possibly dangerous cult. The African Hebrews wear vibrant clothing, follow a vegan diet and do not smoke or drink. Birth control is prohibited. The men often have multiple wives. Since they were not Jews, the Israeli government denied them work permits and health care and threatened to deport them. Mr. Ben-Israel, in turn, lashed out with anti-Semitic remarks and accusations of racism.“We came here offering ‘shalom,’ ” Mr. Ben-Israel told The New York Times in 1971. “We have been met with no jobs, no decent housing and Jim Crow policies similar to what we left behind.”Later that year, he told The Baltimore Sun that two million blacks from the United States would wrest Israel from its Jewish inhabitants. “The Lord personally ordered me to take possession of Israel,” he said.More followers made their way to the African Hebrew compound in Dimona, overstaying tourist visas. Tensions flared anew on April 17, 1986, when the police surrounded the village to prevent a planned protest march. Mr. Ben-Israel made an impassioned proclamation of strength to his followers but without the inflammatory talk of earlier years, and they did not push ahead with the march. “We’re sons and daughters of peace,” he said. “We will not leave. We will wait. We will wait.” In 1990, the Israeli government offered the African Hebrews a path to permanent residency and citizenship. In return, the African Hebrews agreed to stop the flow of new members.The community soon became more entwined with Israeli society. Many of its children who grew up in Israel have served in the country’s military. The African Hebrews have opened a small chain of vegan restaurants, and they manufacture tofu cheese for a vegan pizza sold by the Domino’s pizza chain.Mr. Ben-Israel became an Israeli citizen in 2013.He was born Ben Carter in Chicago on Oct. 12, 1939. After dropping out of high school, he served three years in the Army while earning his equivalency diploma, Mr. Ben-Yehuda, the spokesman, said. After his discharge he worked as a metallurgist at the Howard Foundry on the West Side of Chicago, where, he recounted, a black co-worker came up to him one day in 1961 and asked, “Did you know we are descendants of the biblical Israelites?”Mr. Ben-Israel adopted his Hebrew name after studying the Bible. In the turmoil of the 1960s, he allied himself with those who believed that blacks would be better off leaving the United States than trying to change it from within through the civil rights movement. They established a congregation and a meeting place, calling it the A-Beta Hebrew Israel Cultural Center.Mr. Ben-Israel took about 350 of his followers to Liberia in 1967 as part of what he called a cleansing process, which lasted two and a half years. Some followers died. A few remained in Liberia. Most went back to the United States, but Mr. Ben-Israel and about 140 others went on to Israel.He is survived by four wives, Tikvah, Yoninah, Baht Zion and Baht Ammi; 25 children; 45 grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.His followers spoke of Mr. Ben-Israel as having been anointed by God to lead them, though he made no claims to being divine, Mr. Ben-Yehuda said. Yet, he said, Mr. Ben-Israel was once asked if he was the messiah, and he answered with a parable:“Someone came up to two people — a wise man and a fool — saying, ‘Ben Ammi is the Messiah!’  The fool jumped up and said, ‘No, he’s not!’  Whereas the wise man looked around at the state of the world and replied, ‘I don’t know, but I sure hope that he is!’ ”",2015-01-01T02:04:45+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/middleeast/ben-ammi-ben-israel-leader-of-black-americans-who-migrated-to-israel-dies-at-75.html,895,20
New York Times,"KILLEEN, Tex. — Sgt. First Class Ramon Morris, a muscular dynamo and a father on his fifth deployment, was killed Dec. 12 in a roadside bombing in Afghanistan.But in the state of New York, where he grew up in Queens as a Jamaican immigrant eager to serve, flags at government buildings were not lowered to half-staff until 10 days after his death — and only, his friends say, after they complained.“They had forgotten. We had to call to remind them,” said Danielle Jones, a longtime friend of the sergeant. “The whole country has forgotten. People don’t realize we still have troops risking their lives out there.”On Wednesday, as 2014 came to a close, the United States and allied forces formally turned over combat operations in Afghanistan to Afghans, officially ending the longest war in America’s history, and starting a new struggle for recognition among many military families who say they already feel forgotten.Here at Fort Hood, the country’s largest Army base, there was no parade for the formal conclusion of the war.The official end of the conflict, which began in October 2001, means little to many of the families on this sprawling installation, where anxiety and casualties have been routine for more than a decade. Despite President Obama’s urging American troops this month to be proud of bringing the combat “to a responsible end,” the wars that began after 9/11 remain ever-present at Fort Hood. ImageThird Cavalry Regiment soldiers at an operating base in Laghman Province prepared on Wednesday for their return home to the United States.Credit...Lucas Jackson/ReutersMany soldiers are still fighting physical wounds and mental trauma. Some are shipping out to train Afghan troops and protect the places where Americans remain, leaving behind spouses and children as the divide between military and civilian life in America keeps growing. “They change the name of the mission, but the mission doesn’t change,” said Sergeant Morris’s fiancée, Christiana Strange, who must raise their 3-year-old daughter, Ariana, without him. “It still weighs very heavily on us, even if the rest of the country doesn’t pay much attention.”The war in Afghanistan initially had strong support and a clear mission — to pursue Al Qaeda and topple the Taliban government that had given refuge to terrorists. But the length and cost of the war have long since overshadowed the initial goals.The effort to rout the Taliban has, by some estimates, cost almost $1 trillion. As of Dec. 16, a total of 2,242 United States troops had died in Afghanistan and 19,945 had been wounded.Even with the official end of combat, more casualties may still arrive. Operation Enduring Freedom, as the Pentagon called the war in Afghanistan, will now become Operation Resolute Support, a scaled-down mission involving about 12,000 troops who will indefinitely advise Afghan forces in the fight against Taliban insurgents.For troops there, little will change. They will still qualify for hazard pay and combat decorations, as they did before combat operations ended.“Not much has changed for us, we are still deploying all over the world,” said Meghan Killen, a former soldier who oversees family support services for Sergeant Morris’s unit. “We still have a job to do.”ImageSgt. First Class Ramon Morris, above, was killed by a roadside bomb on Dec. 12 in Afghanistan.Yet the sense of a grand mission has faded, and weariness about the war can be felt in the neighborhoods around Fort Hood, where almost everybody is somehow tied to the Army. The yellow ribbons and other overt displays of support that accompanied the start of the war are now rarely seen.At Vida y Muerte, a tattoo parlor near Fort Hood’s main gate, Jason Siddoway, an Iraq War veteran who became a tattoo artist, said requests for military designs, once common, had become rare, even though the vast majority of customers are enlisted.“It’s a different time in the Army,” he said. “It’s less pride about the big mission, more about just getting through the deployments.”Jesus Jimenez, the owner of the tattoo shop and also a veteran, said he was not aware that troops were still in Afghanistan.On the post here in Central Texas on Wednesday, the closest thing to a ceremony for the end of the war was a line of soldiers who silently marched out to raise the American flag high above the headquarters, commemorating the start of another duty day.Sergeant Morris would have been familiar with the ritual. He served in the Army for the entire war, and like thousands of troops, he showed the wear of prolonged combat.He moved from Jamaica to Queens as a teenager and enlisted after high school, in 1996. By the time he met Ms. Strange in a military cafeteria in 2007, he had deployed three times to Iraq and once to South Korea.He was physically imposing but gentle and kind, and he often helped families when other soldiers were deployed, Ms. Strange said. His deployments left him uneasy around crowds, and he avoided supermarkets and restaurants, said Ms. Strange, who is in the Army Reserves. He loved time spent playing with his daughter, she said.Despite several close calls with roadside bombs in Iraq, she said, he felt untouchable and enjoyed the rush of combat missions. “Others were hurt all around him, but he never had a scratch,” Ms. Strange said. “He joked that he had the hand of God over him.”The tours left him with an injured back. He had a Purple Heart, but would never tell his fiancée how he had earned it.His injuries could easily have helped Sergeant Morris avoid another deployment, Ms. Strange said, “but he never complained.”“He had too much pride and he loved what he did,” she added. “He felt it was wrong to complain when he was alive and others weren’t. There was work to do, and he wanted to be there for his soldiers.”Sergeant Morris’s unit, the Third Cavalry Regiment, arrived in Afghanistan in June to close down American bases and turn them over to the Afghan government. He led a platoon that patrolled a buffer zone to combat frequent Taliban rocket and mortar fire, while other soldiers packed up from a decade of war.ImageDorothy Lewis, whose husband, Christopher, was injured in a Dec. 12 bombing in Afghanistan, and their three children in the kitchen of their home near Fort Hood.Credit...Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York TimesIn small ceremonies this fall, the regiment turned over bases to the Afghans. The unit took over security of the buffer zone around Bagram Airfield, one of the few bases that will continue to house American troops.In interviews this week, officers in Sergeant Morris’s unit expressed confidence in the growing ability of the Afghan forces to maintain stability. But before turning bases over to Afghan security forces, troops cleared anything that could later be used by the enemy, cutting most of the wiring into four-inch lengths so it could not be used in improvised explosive devices.“Some provinces had more enemy than others, but they were all dangerous,” Col. Cameron Cantlon, commander of Sergeant Morris’s regiment, said in an interview from Afghanistan. “There are no shortage of people who want to do us harm.” During this effort, the long days searching for roadside bombs began to wear on Sergeant Morris. He told Ms. Strange that the work was becoming dangerous and that he had a bad feeling. Deployments felt different now that he had a child, he told her.In an email the day before his death, Sergeant Morris told his fiancée that he expected to be home soon, adding, “I’m tired and stressed out with this place and want to be home.”A roadside bomb hit the sergeant’s armored vehicle on a paved road a few miles from the airfield, killing him at 37 and Specialist Wyatt Martin, 22, of Mesa, Ariz., and injuring three others. Officially, they were the final casualties of the 13-year war.Dorothy Lewis, the wife of one of the sergeants wounded in the blast, said in an interview at her home near Fort Hood that the war had moved so far from people’s minds that her extended family sometimes forgot that her husband was deployed.Above the fireplace, her husband’s empty Christmas stocking hung with four others.Over three deployments, Mrs. Lewis, who has three children, endured not by focusing on the big questions of war, but by organizing potluck meals and meet-ups and performing other small acts of kindness. Her husband, Christopher, walked away from the wrecked military vehicle with a few cuts and a concussion, she said. Even though two of his colleagues died that day, he decided to keep doing missions with his unit. “The war isn’t over for them,” Mrs. Lewis said. “And when they come home, others will replace them for I don’t know how long. I’m sure the fact that combat operations are over means something to somebody somewhere, but not us.”",2015-01-01T02:10:09+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/us/mission-ends-but-sacrifices-are-not-over-for-us-soldiers.html,1425,1

New York Times,"MOSCOW — In the end, Russia’s “white ribbon” opposition, which roared to life in December 2011 hoping to oust Vladimir V. Putin from power, came down to this: not quite two dozen stalwarts huddled all night inside an oversize Christmas tree ornament just outside the Kremlin walls, awaiting inevitable arrest. By morning, it came.They were quickly removed from the ornament, a glittering white orb, the last stragglers of what had been a crowd of about 3,000 people who had gathered Tuesday evening to protest the conviction on fraud charges of Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption crusader and Kremlin antagonist, and his brother, Oleg, who was charged along with him.Mr. Navalny, who was perhaps the closest thing the white ribbon movement ever had to a leader, never made it to the unauthorized rally on Manezh Square. Although he broke out of house arrest, he was intercepted by the police about a block away from the rally and was forcibly returned to his apartment, where five officers were posted outside his door to be sure he did not leave again.Russia’s well-practiced riot police, known as the OMON, dispersed most of the crowd with devastating effectiveness. After trampling through a holiday gnome village set up on the square, they pushed most of the crowd into the underground passageways leading to the subway, arresting more than 100 people in the process.That left the die-hards entrenched in the big glass ornament as a metaphor for the Russian political opposition movement as a whole: shivering and diminished, confident in the rightness of their cause, but also hoping for reinforcements that never arrived.Their photos, posted on Twitter throughout the night as the temperature dipped to minus 6 degrees Fahrenheit and from the police van that carried them away, showed that some of them were mildly famous.There was Maria Alyokhina, of the punk band Pussy Riot, who spent nearly two years in prison after being convicted of hooliganism for a protest against Mr. Putin in Moscow’s main cathedral.ImagePolice officers at the square formed a blockade.Credit...Tatyana Makeyeva/ReutersThere was Maria Baronova, who spent six months fighting prosecution on charges of assaulting a police officer at a protest against Mr. Putin that turned violent in May 2012 but was granted amnesty in December 2013 ahead of the Sochi Olympics.And there was Arseny Bobrovsky, half of the popular satirical duo @KermlinRussia, whose partner, Katya Romanovskaya, once awoke to find a 200-pound wooden penis had been left on the roof of her car.The rest of the group were dedicated but unknown supporters of the anti-Putin movement, remnants of an uprising that for a few brief months in early 2012 had managed to consistently put tens of thousands of people on the streets of Moscow.Steadily, firmly, Mr. Putin crushed them.Like Mr. Navalny, a number of the best-known faces of the movement, people who stood on stage at the protests, have been prosecuted by the Russian criminal justice system. Others have fled the country fearing arrest, and still others have quietly moved on with their lives, as opposing Mr. Putin has seemed increasingly futile.Sergei Udaltsov, the always black-clad leader of the radical-socialist group, Left Front, was convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government, along with a top lieutenant, Leonid Razvozzhayev, who had tried to seek asylum in the West but was kidnapped in Kiev, Ukraine, and returned to Moscow. They are each serving four and a half years in prison.Kseniya Sobchak, a television hostess and daughter of one of Mr. Putin’s political mentors, Anatoly A. Sobchak, a former mayor of St. Petersburg who died in 2000, has mostly dropped out of the political limelight. She continues to host a television show on the independent Internet television station Rain, as well as a game show.During the 2012 protests, Ms. Sobchak was part of an opposition movement power couple. Her boyfriend then, Ilya Yashin, was a main organizer of the protest and a leader of the People’s Freedom Party, a group that included the former chess champion Garry Kasparov. (Mr. Kasparov, like many prominent opposition figures, now lives in self-imposed exile in New York.)ImagePolice officers detained a supporter of Mr. Navalny, an anticorruption activist and blogger.Credit...Sergei Ilnitsky/European Pressphoto AgencyMs. Sobchak broke up with Mr. Yashin and married a fellow television personality and actor named Maksim Vitorgan.In an interview before Tuesday’s verdict in which he was given a suspended sentence of three and a half years, Mr. Navalny said opposition leaders were simply intimidated, with 45 criminal cases opened against 20 members of the coordinating council that had organized the protests in 2012.“People are afraid,” Mr. Navalny said. “Totally destroyed.”He said that Mr. Putin had changed the stakes with the invasion of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine, where Russian soldiers have been dying, along with thousands of civilians.“There is a war, people are dying,” Mr. Navalny said. “They are taking down the tombstones of those Pskov paratroopers so that the names aren’t written on their graves. And on the background of all this, discussion of corruption and elections and all of this, the main topics of the democratic movement, it looks, well, kind of silly.”The only prominent mainstream public officials to support the white ribbon movement, Gennadi V. Gudkov, his son, Dmitry G. Gudkov, and Ilya V. Ponomarev, who were then members of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of Parliament, have also come under severe pressure.Gennadi Gudkov was stripped of his seat in Parliament in September 2012, after being accused of violating the law by operating a business while serving as a lawmaker.Dmitry Gudkov remains in Parliament along with Mr. Ponomarev, where they are independents. Mr. Ponomarev was the only legislator to vote against Russia’s annexation of Crimea; Mr. Gudkov abstained. Still, they face constant criticism or harassment.Navalny on Putin, Being Bugged and RevolutionAleksei A. Navalny rose to prominence as an anticorruption blogger with a special knack for turning a memorable phrase.Mr. Gudkov was accused of treason after a visit to the United States in March 2013; Mr. Ponomarev has been accused of embezzling money from Skolkovo, a government-financed research institute.Reached by telephone in New York, where he was spending New Year’s and having a delayed honeymoon, Mr. Gudkov said he believed that Mr. Putin had succeeded in suppressing the protests of 2011 and 2012, which were led by the urban middle class. But he said Russia’s current economic problems would soon activate a much broader swath of society, as people feel the effects of high inflation, a weakened currency and budget cuts required by lower oil prices.“Now, it’s only middle class, but next year it will hit the rest of the people,” Mr. Gudkov said. “In 2011 and 2012, it was the political protest, now we are expecting the economic protests.”He acknowledged that there appeared to be few leaders among the political opposition at the moment but said more than enough were waiting in the wings, including the well-respected former finance minister Aleksei L. Kudrin, who remains in Russia, and the former Yukos oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who has lived in Switzerland since Mr. Putin pardoned him last year after 10 years in jail.“We don’t have leaders because it’s impossible to develop in this political system, you have no access to the television, you have no access to other mass media,” Mr. Gudkov said. “You can only use the Internet, but you know what’s happening with Internet in today’s Russia.”Mr. Gudkov said he believed Mr. Putin’s sky-high approval ratings were illusory, a reaction to the manufactured image presented on government television. “Today you can have 80 percent, tomorrow you will have 20 percent,” he said. “But we know that tomorrow we will have inflation, we will have an economic crisis, we will have the capital flight. People will lose their jobs.”In the freezing cold on Manezh Square, the large Christmas ornament’s white lights made the protesters inside look like dolls caught in a snow globe. Some posed for photos in pairs, holding two hand-scrawled signs. One read, “We’re in the globe,” the other, “While Navalny’s brother is in jail.”They gave interviews and chatted with the police, wrapped themselves in blankets, ate pizza and drank hot tea that froze if left sitting for too long.At one point @KermlinRussia, which has more than one million followers on Twitter, posted, “We’re waiting for you in the ball.” The crowds never materialized.",2015-01-01T02:26:43+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/europe/anti-putin-protest-fizzles-as-police-sweep-square.html,1367,4
New York Times,"HONG KONG — At least 36 people were killed and 47 injured in a stampede during New Year’s Eve celebrations in Shanghai, the city’s government reported.The deaths occurred in the eastern city’s famous Bund, the riverside area where tens of thousands had gathered.The stampede began after 11:35 p.m. in Chen Yi Square, the city said. The exact cause was unclear. President Xi Jinping ordered an immediate investigation, the official Xinhua news service reported.In interviews Thursday at a local hospital, people who had been at the scene said that most of the victims were young people, including a 16-year-old girl.Images posted online showed huge crowds filling the pedestrian areas along the Huangpu River for a midnight light show.Wu Tao, a man from Anhui Province, told the Shanghai-based news website Eastday.com that shortly before the stampede began, the crowd in the square had grown disorderly.About 11:50 p.m., people in a nearby building began dropping green pieces of paper that looked like American $100 bills, which set off a rush, Eastday.com quoted Mr. Wu as saying. Some witnesses said they saw the fake cash fliers but did not think they played a role in setting off the stampede.Xiao Ji, who said he had been in the square, wrote on his Weibo account: “All of a sudden, the whole crowd stopped moving — lots of crying and shouting. The police were helping too but there were so many people. I saw people faint in front of me. I was so scared.”ImageRelatives of a stampede victim at the hospital in Shanghai.Credit...Aly Song/ReutersGuo Xianzhong, a journalist with the Southern Metropolis Daily who was at the scene, wrote that the crush of people occurred on a stairway to a viewing platform near the prewar Peace Hotel.“People who wanted to come up and those who wanted to go down became congested, with more and more people filling in, and it became tense,” he wrote on the newspaper’s website.Around 11:30 p.m., there were sounds of women screaming and children crying.

New York Times,"Among the New Yorkers preparing for New Year’s Eve festivities on Wednesday afternoon — like a young woman applying eye shadow on the G train, or the thousands of revelers who had already turned Times Square into a no-walk zone — were a few whose arrangements could be heard a Brooklyn neighborhood away.Standing amid the sculptures of the Pratt Institute campus in Clinton Hill was a gaggle of men in a thick puff of white steam. They were girding their ears against the clamor of a dozen large whistles, whose noise made conversation impossible, terrified squirrels, sent one passer-by with a baby carriage sprinting away and had another holding a camera dashing forward in glee.But it was just a preview of what was to come: the latest — and probably last — edition of the antique steam-whistle cacophony that Conrad Milster, Pratt’s longtime chief engineer, has orchestrated every New Year’s Eve since 1965. By midnight, a crowd of hundreds had gathered to hear the campus transformed into the sonic equivalent of a 19th-century harbor, train station and circus tent all tumbled into one. The whistles bring to deafening life an earlier era of Brooklyn, when industrialists like Charles Pratt, the institute’s founder, built the mansions of Clinton Hill; when the institute trained engineers instead of artists; and when steam-powered ferries crisscrossed the East River. Now, like the intact Ames steam engines that hunker in Mr. Milster’s engine room and that powered the Pratt campus until 1977, they are going into retirement.“What I like to think is that this is the voice of the Victorian era,” when machinery was steam-driven and the steam engine was “the marvel of civilization,” Mr. Milster, 79, said. “So the whistle is just one small part of an old picture, and you can’t very well save a 1,000-foot-long steamship, so you try to save artifacts, including the whistle.”Citing safety and insurance concerns, Pratt officials nudged Mr. Milster to make last year’s New Year’s Eve blowout the last, but, he said, they eventually agreed to let him hold the final one this year to give people one more chance to witness the show.So out came the assortment of steam whistles from locomotives, ferries and factories that he has collected over the years, the oldest from 1884, the youngest from a World War II Liberty ship. As they have for years, steam-whistle collectors came to campus with contributions of their own, including Gilman Wright, 67, of Montpelier, Vt., who had brought a whistle and a siren salvaged from the U.S.S. Judith Ann Meseck, a World War II rescue tugboat.Mr. Wright had discovered these relics on — of course — eBay, but had never blown them until Wednesday, when he connected them to the row of Mr. Milster’s whistles, connected by a pipe to a steam hose, whereupon the siren produced a terrifying wail like something out of the London Blitz.Out, too, came the calliope, a kind of steam-whistle organ that Mr. Milster built for the turn of the millennium in 1999. Once, calliopes announced the arrivals of riverboats and traveling circuses; now, one of Mr. Milster’s helpers, Frank Sokolow, had their modern version electronically rigged to play prerecorded ditties like “Beer Barrel Polka.”Mr. Milster hopes a museum or other collectors will rescue the whistles after they are retired from Pratt.“If you’re here, you feel the rumble and the tremble in your body,” said Delvon Mack, 35, a Pratt plumber who helped set up the whistles. “It’s a beautiful thing. You hate to see history end, but I guess that’s why you call it history.”",2015-01-01T02:53:58+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/nyregion/on-brooklyn-campus-annual-antique-display-goes-out-with-a-terrifying-wail.html,605,16
New York Times,"MEXICO CITY — A performance artist who was arrested Tuesday, along with several dissidents and journalists, after she sought to test change in Cuba and promote free speech by setting up an open mike in Havana’s Revolution Square was briefly detained again on Wednesday and told she could not leave the country for several weeks.The arrests, which disrupted the event, were the most sweeping roundup of dissidents in the two weeks since the United States and Cuba said they would normalize diplomatic relations and President Obama moved to loosen several trade and travel restrictions associated with the five-decade economic embargo.President Raúl Castro has said that Cuba’s political system, which limits freedom of expression, will not change, and the Cuban authorities made it clear that they would not tolerate what they called a “political provocation” by the artist, Tania Bruguera, and her supporters.Ms. Bruguera, who splits her time between Cuba and New York, had planned to set up the microphone on Tuesday afternoon and allow Cubans to speak for a minute at a time, articulating their visions for the country’s future. Instead, she was detained at her mother’s home hours before the event and released Wednesday afternoon, along with several others.In a statement on her sister’s Facebook page, Ms. Bruguera said she had been held on public disorder charges. She then announced a news conference and public gathering on the Malecón, Havana’s coastal highway, at the memorial to the Maine, the American battleship that sank in Havana Harbor in 1898. How America’s Relationship With Cuba Will ChangeSome trade and travel restrictions will be eased. Others depend on congressional action.Agents stopped her en route to the gathering and took her away, her sister said. In a Facebook post on Wednesday evening, her sister, Deborah Bruguera, who lives in Italy, said Ms. Bruguera had been interrogated about her motives and her supporters and was told she could not leave Cuba “for two or three months” while the case was being processed.Cuba made no official statement on the detentions, but the authorities had declined to issue Ms. Bruguera a permit for the event. Dissidents said several dozen people had been arrested, with most let go Tuesday or Wednesday. Those detained included Reinaldo Escobar, editor of the independent news site 14ymedio.com and the husband of the opposition blogger Yoani Sánchez, who said she had been briefly put under house arrest.The State Department condemned the arrests several hours after they unfolded on Tuesday. “As part of the process of normalization of diplomatic relations, the United States will continue to press the Cuban government to uphold its international obligations and to respect the rights of Cubans to peacefully assemble and express their ideas and opinions,” its statement said. People opposed to the resumption of relations with Cuba were quick to hold up the arrests as a sign that the Castro government had no intention of pursuing political change and would reap only economic benefits from Mr. Obama’s moves.“Castro govt. arrests of activists in #Havana exposes the folly of new Obama #CubaPolicy,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a Cuban-American, wrote on Twitter.",2015-01-01T03:01:18+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/americas/cuba-arrests-dissidents-2-weeks-after-us-accord.html,502,6
New York Times,"MIAMI — Two weeks after the release of an imprisoned spy whom President Obama called “one of the most important intelligence agents the United States has ever had in Cuba,” the man’s family is still asking: Where is he?Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, 51, is a former Cuban intelligence officer who was serving a 25-year prison sentence for espionage. Few people in or out of Cuba had heard of him until Dec. 17, when Mr. Obama announced that a man “whose sacrifice has been known to only a few” was safe on American shores after 19 years behind bars in Cuba. In exchange for Mr. Sarraff, the United States freed three Cuban agents jailed here since 1998, as the two countries moved toward normalizing diplomatic relations. The Cuban government also freed an American subcontractor held for five years for bringing communications equipment into the country. But Mr. Sarraff has yet to surface in public or to contact his parents, whom he had been calling daily from prison.Mr. Sarraff’s sister, Vilma, said her family grew alarmed on Dec. 16 when her brother failed to make his daily phone call from prison to his parents. They then learned he had been released from Cuba’s Villa Marista prison, but since then, no American or Cuban official has notified the family of his whereabouts, she said.“We still don’t know where he is,” Ms. Sarraff said.A senior American official said it was unclear why the former secret agent had not contacted his parents in Havana or his sisters in Spain because he was free to make phone calls. “He’s not being held captive,” the official said.Although the president did not publicly name Mr. Sarraff, a first lieutenant who was jailed in 1995, several current and former American officials confirmed his identity.In a statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said only that the C.I.A. asset freed in the prisoner exchange provided information that helped the government identify and convict several American and Cuban spies inside the United States.In previous cases, the United States has held foreign spies received in prisoner exchanges at military bases, where they were extensively debriefed before the authorities began the process of moving them back into society.“My debriefing took two years,” said Enrique García Díaz, a former Cuban intelligence official who defected from Cuba in 1989. Mr. García said he was interviewed at a military base, held at a safe house in Virginia and then in another house near C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va.He eventually had his own place to live as well as a car, and he could come and go as he pleased, but he continued to be debriefed by the agency. It was eight months before he was allowed contact with the news media, and even that was with the United States-funded Radio Martí, he said. Because the Cuban government had cut off his parents’ phone as soon as he defected, it was two years before he had contact with his family.“Sarraff’s debriefing should not take so long because he has been in prison so long that he probably does not have current information,” Mr. García said. “But someone has to explain how he got arrested — who ratted him out.”During the Cold War, the United States often gave new identities, money and security protection to Soviet spies because of concerns that undercover operatives working for the Soviet Union could seek retribution.“My impression is that he’s going to be out of circulation for quite some time,” said Domingo Amuchastegui, a former Cuban intelligence official who is now a political analyst in South Florida. “They have to learn all the things that were connected to his arrest, where he was arrested, how he was arrested, what failed, what are the questions that have been going on over these 20 years.”",2015-01-01T03:20:29+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/americas/whereabouts-of-us-spy-released-in-cuba-deal-are-unknown.html,641,6
New York Times,"All Julio Olmedo needed was five years. That would be enough time to find a job in the United States, build his savings and then return to Mexico with enough money to start his own produce business.That was the plan.At 12, Mr. Olmedo quit school and began working to help support his parents and siblings. He worked 15-hour days for a fruit and vegetable vendor, loading and unloading produce from trucks that traveled from village to village. Mr. Olmedo said he grew tired of being the low man on the totem pole.So, in a bid to improve his life, he came to New York City in 2007, when he was 15. He arrived in New York at 6 a.m. and found work as a dishwasher by 3 p.m.Mr. Olmedo first settled into a Bronx apartment, where he lived with as many as eight other immigrants. He worked a number of low-paying jobs and sent some of his earnings to his mother in Mexico. Mr. Olmedo’s parents separated shortly after he arrived in New York, and his mother was raising his 14-year-old half brother on her own.“I sent money for him to go to school, for the things that he needs,” Mr. Olmedo said.In 2009, Mr. Olmedo moved to Woodridge, N.Y., in the Catskills, and worked at a supermarket. His poor grasp of English began to frustrate him because he could not help customers. Watching so many families come into the store made him homesick.“Most of the families, there was a father, a mother and children,” Mr. Olmedo said. “That reminded me of when I was back in Mexico, when I was 5 or 6 years old, and my mother and father were together. Now I am here all alone.”Loneliness led to an epiphany, he said.Mr. Olmedo was again stuck at the bottom of a job ladder and he was unable to save much money. The ambitions that brought him to the United States had been squashed. He needed a new plan.The Neediest CasesThe New York Times Neediest Cases Fund provides direct assistance to struggling New Yorkers. Tap for information about how to donate.“I realized I don’t want this forever,” he said.Determined to get an education, Mr. Olmedo returned to New York City. He moved into an apartment in Brooklyn with an older brother, Humberto, who had come to New York in 2008. Mr. Olmedo began to take English classes at the Door, a nonprofit youth development organization, and he also enrolled at Liberty High School Academy for Newcomers.Mr. Olmedo was kicked out of his brother’s apartment by the building management because he was not on the lease. After two weeks of sleeping on subway trains, Mr. Olmedo told a teacher at the Door about his situation. The organization’s executive director contacted the Children’s Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which placed Mr. Olmedo in the foster care system at the age of 17.Mr. Olmedo next set his sights on college and a new career. He said he wants to work for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.“When I was living in Brooklyn, I had seen other children who were going to high school and most of them were involved with drugs,” he said. Mr. Olmedo said he often saw the police stopping low-level dealers, while larger drug dealers remained free. “That’s why I want to be a special agent of the D.E.A., to arrest the real criminals.”In 2012, Mr. Olmedo received his green card. In 2013, he turned 21 and moved out of foster care. That summer, he began attending John Jay College of Criminal Justice, pursuing his bachelor’s degree.In September, Mr. Olmedo, now 22, moved into a studio apartment at a low-income housing development. The Children’s Aid Society used $1,000 from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy a bed, a kitchen table, chairs and other items to make Mr. Olmedo feel more at home.Since November, Mr. Olmedo has been a peer mentor at the Pan American International High School, working with students, encouraging them to attend college and to be mindful of their futures. He earns $500 a month for his work.“Right now, I have my papers,” Mr. Olmedo said. “I have an opportunity to go to college. I have an opportunity to get a better job.

New York Times,"TOKYO — In a nationally televised New Year’s speech, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Thursday that he was open to holding a summit meeting with the South Korean president, proclaiming his willingness to make a “big shift” in the tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Mr. Kim was apparently responding to an overture this week by South Korea to resume high-level dialogue. He spent much of the annual 30-minute speech, his third since taking control of the isolated Communist country, calling for improved relations between the rival Koreas. In the speech, carried on state-run television, he also signaled that he was willing to meet directly with President Park Geun-hye of South Korea. “Depending on the mood and circumstances to be created, we have no reason not to hold the highest-level talks,” said Mr. Kim, who spoke before a red flag with the hammer, sickle and calligraphy brush symbol of the Workers’ Party. Timeline on North Korea’s Nuclear ProgramThe country’s nuclear weapons program and its development of long-range rocket systems have angered many in the West, including in the United States.It remained unclear whether his offer was truly an overture, or just another ploy in the constant maneuverings between the Koreas, which remain technically at war more than 60 years after combat on the peninsula ended. Tensions have risen recently amid suspicions that North Korean hackers may have been behind cyberattacks on a South Korean nuclear plant operator.The United States may also be engaged in a shadowy cyberconflict with the North, whose tenuous Internet connections have suffered major disruptions, just weeks after a devastating digital breach of Sony Pictures for which the F.B.I. has blamed the Kim government. The tensions over the cyberattacks have added to a continuing standoff over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.In the speech, Mr. Kim said a summit meeting or other high-level talks would be possible if the South showed it was serious about easing tensions.“If South Korean authorities sincerely want to improve relations between North and South Korea through talks, we can resume stalled high-level meetings,” he said, according to Reuters.On Monday, South Korea offered to hold minister-level talks on issues like reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. The administration of Ms. Park has cited this year’s 70th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula as a chance to thaw ties between the Koreas.",2015-01-01T03:52:57+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/asia/north-korea-leader-seeks-meeting-with-south.html,375,10
New York Times,"It was a confounding year in global financial markets. Not because it was a disaster for most investors; American stocks and bonds both rose in value. It was confounding because of some major moves that defied expert consensus this time a year ago — not only what was predicted, but what was even thought plausible.But by understanding what the biggest market moves were, you can also understand the forces that will shape the global economy in 2015.There was an epic collapse in oil prices.It’s not that the price of oil has never moved as far and as fast as it did in 2014. It’s just that usually when that happens, it occurs against the backdrop of much more global volatility, like in a worldwide recession at the end of 2008 and early 2009.What’s remarkable about the roughly 50 percent decline in the price of oil in the second half of the year is that it occurred amid such stability; nothing radical changed in that time about either the global economic outlook or even the supply and demand picture for oil itself.Rather, years of effort to increase drilling in the United States, paired with a continued tepid world economy and with decisions by Saudi Arabia and other oil producers not to pull back on production to defend high prices, created a stunning sell-off.We’ve already started to see some of the geopolitical consequences of this shift, including the collapse in value of the ruble and new pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. But that is probably only the beginning. The budgets of major oil producers, from Venezuela to Indonesia to Texas, will be stretched. Meanwhile, there will be a nice tailwind to growth around the world as cheaper fuel means higher real incomes for consumers.This was the year when oil prices plunged, but 2015 is the year when we will truly start to understand the consequences.Long-term interest rates kept falling.If there was one thing Wall Street forecasters could agree upon at the end of 2013, it was that 2014 would be a year of rising long-term interest rates in the United States. The economy was finally gaining momentum, after all, the Federal Reserve was winding down its program of buying bonds, and the day of interest rate increases was coming nearer.That narrative was exactly right when it came to the economy and policy. The job market has strengthened, and the Fed has moved to end its interventions in the economy as planned. But the result for bond markets has been the opposite of the conventional wisdom.The yield on United States Treasury bonds fell significantly over the course of the year; the government can borrow money for 30 years for a mere 2.8 percent, down from 4 percent at the end of 2013. These lower costs have translated into cheaper home mortgages and lower borrowing costs for businesses, and higher bond prices (but lower future returns) for investors.As for 2015 implications, the remarkably low long-term interest rates would seem to signal a return to a predicament facing the American economy in the middle of the last decade. Alan Greenspan called it a “conundrum” — that the Fed’s power to influence longer-term interest rates was weak, perhaps because of very strong global demand for safe securities like United States Treasury bonds.Regardless of the cause, it raises the prospect that even as the economy continues to strengthen and the Fed raises rates in 2015, cheap longer-term rates will be here to stay.ImageA trader at work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in July.Credit...Richard Drew/Associated PressThe U.S. stock market kept cruising.The stock market had a remarkable rally in 2013, and some were skeptical that it could continue the run in 2014.It did. But only in the United States.The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 11.4 percent in 2014, not quite the 30 percent return of 2013 but not shabby by any measure. But while 2013 featured a broad rise among all the major global stock markets, the United States was a major outperformer in 2014.The core reason is that the American economy has performed better than its counterparts in much of the rest of the world, with Europe and Japan facing stagnant growth and emerging markets slowing their once-gangbuster pace. A related factor is that the dollar has appreciated compared with other currencies, so the dollars that American companies make are becoming relatively more valuable.Yet another year of stock prices that rise faster than corporate earnings certainly increases the risk of a sharp correction or a period of subpar returns. But in the meantime, Americans can take comfort in the fact that the referendum of global financial markets is that the United States will continue to be the driver of global economic recovery.The dollar soared.The same fundamentals that helped American stocks log another year of impressive returns drove up the dollar versus virtually all other major currencies — but a solid year for United States economic growth wasn’t the entirety of the story.A schism has opened up between the Federal Reserve and its counterparts overseas. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are trying to stimulate growth and fight deflation in their countries (the B.O.J. has already expanded its easing programs, and the E.C.B. appears on the verge of undertaking a form of bond-buying of its own). But the Fed has been signaling higher rates and tighter money.That has made the dollar more attractive, as has the sense that it is a beacon of economic strength in a troubled world economy. Those factors explain the 12 percent drop in the euro against the dollar and the 14 percent drop in the Japanese yen.But the strengthening dollar has implications for 2015 far beyond the finances of Americans thinking of visiting Paris this spring.The dollar is sufficiently enmeshed in the infrastructure of the global economy that a stronger dollar means, in effect, a tightening of global financial conditions, as Hyun Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements has argued.If you are a company doing business in Mexico or South Korea, for example, and borrow money in dollars, a rising dollar makes repaying your debts more onerous and has the same effect as a hike in interest rates, potentially squeezing your cash flows or even leading to bankruptcy. Look for those ripple effects of a strong dollar across the globe in 2015.The outlook for inflation fell.Global investors are betting on very, very low inflation, for many years to come. That is the implication, anyway, of the relative prices of inflation-adjusted bonds and regular bonds in the United States and almost every other major economy.Part of this is easy to explain. The decline in oil and other commodity prices will put downward pressure on prices in 2015. But a broader shift in sentiment happened in recent months. Investors seem to think that very low inflation will persist even after the oil price declines of the last few months fully spread through other consumer prices. Bond prices currently imply that inflation from 2019 to 2024 will be 2.14 percent a year, down from 2.65 percent a year ago.Investor expectations suggest that the Fed may have more leeway than it had seemed a few months ago to keep interest rates low, especially if they see continued weakness in the economy.And given that similar trends are visible across the advanced world, it implies that one of the foremost challenges for policy is finding a way to get the world’s major economies humming enough that deflation is no longer a concern.",2015-01-01T05:31:13+0000,The Upshot,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/upshot/five-surprising-economic-trends-in-2014-and-what-they-mean-for-2015.html,1269,3

But The Associated Press reported that more ships arrived on Friday with sensitive equipment.On Thursday, the head of the National Search and Rescue Agency, Bambang Soelistyo, said in Jakarta that the bodies of nine of the 162 people who had been aboard Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 had been recovered. Six had been sent to Jakarta; two were in Pangkalan Bun, close to the site of the crash; and one remained aboard a navy ship.

New York Times,"CAIRO — Egypt’s highest appeals court on Thursday ordered a retrial for three imprisoned journalists from Al Jazeera’s English-language service, implicitly acknowledging critical procedural flaws in a case that rights advocates have described, from the men’s arrests to their convictions, as a sham. But the decision offered no guarantees that the journalists, who have been imprisoned for more than a year and now face a potentially lengthy second trial, would be freed anytime soon.The convictions of the three men, Mohamed Fahmy, Baher Mohamed and Peter Greste, focused international condemnation on the government, drawing attention to a sweeping crackdown on news media freedom and political dissent since the military ouster of the country’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.And from its beginnings, analysts say, the case has perhaps had little to do with the actions of the journalists themselves. Instead, they suggest it reflects a bitter dispute between Egypt’s military-backed government, led by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Qatar, which owns Al Jazeera and has been a strong backer of his Islamist opponents in the Muslim Brotherhood.The men were convicted in June on charges that included conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood to broadcast false reports, though prosecutors presented no evidence for such claims. All three were sentenced to seven-year prison terms, but Mr. Mohamed received three additional years for possessing a spent bullet casing that he picked up at an anti-government street protest.The case has drawn special notice partly because the defendants had reputations as experienced journalists and had in the past worked for other well-known international news organizations. But their ordeal, which the men have outlined in letters from prison and in messages sent through family members, has also highlighted the plight of thousands of Egyptians — including Islamists, leftist activists and other journalists — swept up by the authorities on charges that are widely viewed as politically motivated.As the families of the Al Jazeera journalists sifted through the meaning of the latest court decision on Thursday, they applauded the court’s apparent criticism of the first trial but expressed disappointment that the judges had not granted a request to suspend the men’s sentences. ImageMarwa Omara, the fiancée of Mr. Fahmy, one of the three journalists who was imprisoned in Egypt, said she was optimistic after the court ordered a retrial on Thursday.Credit...Khaled Desouki/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“We’ve learned not to expect anything,” said Mr. Greste’s father, Juris Greste. “We did expect a little better than this.” Amal Clooney, a lawyer for Mr. Fahmy, noting what she said were numerous irregularities with the first trial, said her client could not rely solely “on the Egyptian judicial system to give us a necessarily fair or speedy outcome.” In addition to focusing on the court proceedings Mr. Fahmy’s legal team was “doubling its efforts on the political and diplomatic tracks,” she said. “That seems to be the most promising way to achieve the outcome that is just.”Mr. Sisi has said that the journalists should have been deported rather than stand trial, but he has so far insisted that the government does not interfere in judicial decisions.A recent thaw in relations between Egypt and Qatar, brokered by Saudi Arabia, has raised hopes that the Egyptian president might be more willing to free the men. In December, in a major concession, Qatar suspended the broadcast of an Egyptian affiliate of Al Jazeera that had been sharply critical of Egypt’s government. But the Qatari government has also refused to extradite Brotherhood leaders and supporters wanted by the Egyptian government, a source of continuing tension, according to Egyptian officials.Although the appeals court did not give specifics for its decision, it is regarded as among Egypt’s most rigorous and independent legal bodies and may have been eager to remove the stain on Egypt’s judiciary after the spectacle of the first trial.It was unclear whether the ruling made it any more likely that Mr. Sisi would step in before or during the retrial. The delay of a final decision could be useful in diplomacy with Qatar, or it could be viewed as an obstacle if Egyptian officials were quickly trying to rid themselves of a public-relations headache.VideoAn Egyptian court gave two Al Jazeera English journalists seven-year terms and a third a 10-year term after convicting them of conspiring to broadcast false reports of civil strife.CreditCredit...Khaled Desouki/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. Sisi had issued a decree in November allowing him to deport non-Egyptians convicted of crimes, in an apparent sign that his government was seeking face-saving ways to end what has been an embarrassing case.The decree could free Mr. Fahmy, who holds Canadian and Egyptian citizenship and Mr. Greste, an Australian, but it would not help Mr. Mohamed, an Egyptian citizen.Ms. Clooney said that Mr. Sisi could act in several ways to free the journalists, including by granting a pardon at any time, releasing them on humanitarian grounds, or deporting Mr. Greste and Mr. Fahmy. “There is no reason this can’t happen quickly, and today’s decision doesn’t change that,” she added. In their request for a new trial, lawyers argued that the previous case had had procedural errors, including that a “special court” had been illegally designated to hear the case, according to Negad el-Borai, another lawyer for Mr. Fahmy. The prosecutor also requested a new trial, Mr. Borai said, though the reasons have not been made public.The defendants were not present Thursday, and reporters were barred from entering the court until after the hearing. Relatives of the men spoke to reporters after the decision and seemed stunned that they would not be released.“I don’t know what the next step is,” said Marwa Omara, Mr. Fahmy’s fiancée. “It seems like it’s a long battle.” She added that Canadian officials needed to “do more.” Lawyers said Thursday that the three journalists could still be granted bail at the start of their new trial, which is expected to begin within a month.In a statement after the court decision, Al Jazeera said that the Egyptian authorities had a choice: “Free these men quickly, or continue to string this out, all the while continuing this injustice and harming the image of their own country in the eyes of the world. They should choose the former.”",2015-01-01T10:40:20+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/middleeast/egypt-al-jazeera-journalists-trial.html,982,4
New York Times,"SHANGHAI — With a dazzling light show set to begin at midnight, a huge crowd of revelers had gathered for an outdoor New Year’s Eve in this city’s historic riverfront district. They began to grow unruly.“We were just trying to walk up the steps to see the light show, and then people at the top began pushing their way down,” said a 20-year-old man. “Then I heard someone scream, and people began to panic.”The man, who spoke while awaiting a friend at Shanghai No. 1 People’s Hospital, said, “We got crushed.”In an instant, a stampede trampled and asphyxiated dozens of people. So thick were the crowds here that ambulances struggled to reach the victims, who had been partying moments before and now lay suffering or lifeless, some with dirty footprints on their clothes.By Thursday afternoon, at least 36 people had died in the stampede and 47 were known to be injured, and the police conceded that they had been ill prepared.Even for China, the world’s most populous country, with a history of fatal stampedes and constant worries about crowd control, it was one of the worst public tragedies. It was made more so because the stampede happened during a celebration in a historic showcase area of Shanghai, its version of Times Square.Most of the victims were Chinese in their teens and 20s, who had hoped to ring in 2015 partying in the area, the Bund, the city’s famed riverfront promenade.The stampede was a reminder of the challenges the authorities face in managing China’s megacities. Like other metropolises around the world, Shanghai has made its New Year’s Eve celebration a signature event, with light shows and performances late into the night.This year’s big attraction was billed as a “5D Light Show” that was supposed to project colorful blazes onto the Bund. The light-show festivities included the city’s newest landmark, the 2,074-foot Shanghai Tower, one of the world’s tallest buildings. But at least one of the shows had been canceled ahead of the stampede, and word had not reached all the revelers.Many people who had been milling around the Bund on Wednesday night said the huge crowds simply overwhelmed the authorities and the event organizers in this city of 25 million.Among the dead were 25 women, aged 16 to 36, according to Xinhua, the official news agency. Besides the Chinese residents, the authorities said the casualties included one person from Taiwan and one from Malaysia.A video posted on youku.com appears to show an enormous mass of celebrators pushing and yelling and crushing young people under its weight.Some participants said the crowd may have been even larger than the 300,000 people who, according to an official count, had attended a year ago.ImageIn the aftermath, a woman, above, wept for the victims.Credit...Greg Baker/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAfter the stampede, and the ensuing chaos as ambulances tried to reach victims sprawled in what is usually a busy traffic intersection, the remaining light show was canceled. Police officers stood shoulder to shoulder to permit ambulance access. But many victims died before reaching a hospital, the authorities said.President Xi Jinping ordered an immediate investigation. And by afternoon, the police were even looking into reports that partygoers in a nearby building may have contributed by tossing fake $100 bills into the area.The police later ruled out that theory, saying that the phony currency had been tossed after the stampede.Still, they admitted having not anticipated such a problem. The Xinhua account said “the police expressed regret over their failure to effectively intervene when the tourist flow ‘increased irregularly’ at 11:30 p.m.”Stampedes are more than an occasional risk in China and are not confined to cities, according to examples cited by Xinhua. Last September, six students were killed because of a blocked stairway at a primary school in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last January, 14 worshipers  were crushed at a mosque in northwest China. Thirty-seven people were killed on a Beijing bridge in 2004 during a lantern festival.On Thursday afternoon, four Shanghai hospitals were treating the injured while friends and relatives waited. In the lobby of Changzheng Hospital, the mother of a 16-year-old stampede victim dropped to her knees when told that her daughter had not survived.“I can’t take it! I want to die,” the woman cried as her relatives tried to console her. “I don’t want to live. I can’t go on!”ImageA man praying on Thursday at the site of a deadly stampede in Shanghai.Credit...Ng Han Guan/Associated PressIn China, New Year’s Eve celebrations are a relatively new affair, far less significant and theatrical than the annual Chinese New Year celebrations that take place according to the traditional calendar, usually in late January or early February. And yet, every year, the crowds that gather in major Chinese cities on Dec. 31 seem to get bigger.In Shanghai, the Bund is one of the most popular tourist spots, a strip of hulking, pre-World War II buildings built largely by the British. Now elegantly restored and illuminated at night, the buildings house banks, upscale restaurants, nightclubs and five-star hotels, including the Peace Hotel and the Waldorf-Astoria Shanghai.The city spent $732 million between 2007 and 2010 to renovate the Bund, expanding the promenade and making more room for tourists to delight in gazing at the historic buildings or across the Huangpu River toward the new financial district, filled with high-rise apartment buildings, office towers and oversize advertising displays.The makeover was so successful that much bigger crowds now tour the riverfront day and night, so numerous that some of the luxury shops have relocated.On Thursday, there were large crowds once again walking the Bund, but also police cars and vans in the area near Chen Yi Square. Some visitors placed bouquets near the statue of Chen Yi, a former military commander and onetime Shanghai mayor.At No. 18 on the Bund, police officers could be seen Thursday afternoon visiting the building where a party was held and fake $100 bills were handed out. Inside the building, and out on the street, crumpled bills could still be seen. Calls to the police and the building went unanswered.At Changzheng Hospital, there were tears and even scuffles as visitors demanded information about relatives. A man who declined to give his name said he was at the Bund on Wednesday evening with his 21-year-old cousin, who was crushed to death. The man was comforting that cousin’s older sister and describing what happened.“I was pushed down. I couldn’t breathe,” he said. “I felt I was going to die because I couldn’t breathe. But I couldn’t find my cousin. Now, I came to the hospital. I’ve been here since last night. But now we know my cousin died.”",2015-01-01T12:04:57+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/asia/witnesses-recall-panic-of-deadly-stampede-in-shanghai.html,1102,1
New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan — At least 25 civilians were believed to have died in southern Afghanistan after shelling amid fierce fighting struck a wedding party, Afghan officials said Thursday.The attack occurred Wednesday night in the Sangin district of Helmand Province, the site of some of the heaviest fighting in the country in the past year. Afghan officials said they had begun an investigation of the attack, which wounded more than 50 people, mostly women and children.“We talked to A.N.A. command, but they are denying it,” Haji Mohammad Jan Rasolyaar, the deputy governor of Helmand, said, referring to the Afghan National Army. “That area is a front line, but the incident is an unfortunate one.”Civilian casualties are on the rise in Afghanistan and reached a peak in 2014, according to the United Nations. There were estimates that the death toll would exceed 10,000 in 2014; exact figures are not yet available. The rise in casualties reflects, in part, deadlier ground fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban.Sangin was a focus of Taliban violence in the past year, which engulfed soldiers and police officers fighting to hold on to the center of the district.In Helmand more broadly, more than 1,300 members of the security forces were killed from June to November. In Afghanistan over all, more than 5,000 members of the security forces died last year, an increase from 2013 and a record number since the start of the war.The increase in deaths comes as coalition forces take on a new mission in Afghanistan, stepping back entirely from a combat role to advise and assist Afghan forces. But the change will be subtle for most members of the Afghan security forces, who for more than a year have been fighting on their own. Officials said that a joint committee of representatives of the police and the army, as well as elders, would be sent to the area to determine what had happened. Villagers said they believed that the army was firing rockets or mortar rounds into the village of Bayanzai in Sangin, where a wedding party had gathered awaiting the return of the bride, officials said.“We just sent a delegation comprised of A.N.A. and A.N.P. and elders to Sangin to find out the real cause of the attack and why and how the wedding party has been targeted,” said Omar Zwak, the spokesman for the provincial governor, referring to the army and the Afghan National Police. “We don’t know the accurate figures for casualties. There are more wounded people who have been shifted elsewhere.”",2015-01-01T14:50:49+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/asia/afghanistan-wedding-party-shelling-deaths.html,425,3
New York Times,"Pedestrian deaths in New York City fell to a historic low last year after a push by the city to make streets less dangerous.In 2014, 132 pedestrians died in traffic accidents, the lowest total for a year since the city began keeping records a century ago, officials said. There were 180 pedestrian deaths in 2013, the highest number in a decade.Overall traffic fatalities fell last year to 248, from 293 the previous year, according to preliminary data from the city. There were 20 bicyclist fatalities in 2014, an increase from 12 deaths in 2013, and 37 motorcyclist fatalities last year, down from 42 deaths in 2013. Motor vehicle fatalities remained the same, with 59 deaths in each year.The decline in pedestrians’ deaths comes as the city continues to put in place Mayor Bill de Blasio’s Vision Zero plan, a set of proposals intended to eliminate traffic deaths. Modeled after a Swedish approach that treats all road deaths and serious injuries as inherently preventable, the plan has an ambitious goal of eliminating traffic deaths by 2024. The city lowered its default speed limit to 25 miles per hour, from 30 m.p.h., and increased enforcement of speeding laws, among other initiatives.“There is no question we are moving this city in the right direction, thanks to stepped up enforcement by the N.Y.P.D., strong traffic safety measures by the Department of Transportation, new laws passed by our legislators and the work of New Yorkers fighting for change,” the mayor said in a statement this week.The new speed limit for most city streets went into effect in November. It was the first lowering of the general speed limit since 1964 and required state legislation because of a mandate that local limits could not dip under 30 m.p.h.The City Council has passed a dozen bills on traffic safety, including one called Cooper’s Law, which was named for a 9-year-old boy who was fatally struck by a taxi on the Upper West Side in January. The bill allows the city to suspend and revoke the license of a taxi driver or livery driver who kills or maims a pedestrian who has the right of way.In addition, the police have strengthened enforcement against dangerous driving, increasing summonses for speeding by 42 percent and for failure to yield to pedestrians by 126 percent, city officials said. More than 117,000 drivers were given summonses for speeding last year, compared with about 82,000 in 2013.New York in 2014 also had lower numbers in nearly every major category of crime, including murder, according to Police Department statistics.Paul Steely White, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for pedestrians and cyclists, called the year’s traffic fatalities a “historic reduction.”“Even though we still have way too much preventable carnage on our streets, it’s very encouraging that we can move the needle,” Mr. White said. “The mayor has made this a top priority, and I think that’s the No. 1 factor in what has led to this accomplishment.”Mr. de Blasio has often spoken about Vision Zero in public and has frequently met with the families of victims of fatal crashes, raising the visibility of the issue, Mr. White said.The city’s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said the campaign faced more challenges.“In 2015, we will continue to work with our Vision Zero partners and local communities to make their neighborhoods safer and save more lives,” Ms. Trottenberg said in a statement, “because our work is far from complete.”",2015-01-01T15:37:26+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/new-york-pedestrian-deaths-are-lowest-on-record.html,585,14
New York Times,"Beginning his second term only hours before the death of his father, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Thursday promised to confront some of the most deep-rooted challenges facing New York and the nation: unfairness in the criminal justice system, an eroded economic mobility and the distortion of the public education system from a “great equalizer” during his father’s youth into a “great discriminator” for children born into poverty today.Mr. Cuomo, in a speech that was hauntingly reminiscent of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo’s oratorical style, invoked challenges that have stymied presidents, let alone governors. “The American promise itself is being questioned,” he said. “The offer of fairness and opportunity that was the American compact is now in doubt.”The governor’s inauguration day began with an emotional nod to his father’s absence, and ended with word of his passing. “He couldn’t be here physically today, my father,” Mr. Cuomo said. “But my father is in this room. He’s in the heart and mind of every person who’s here.” Mr. Cuomo, 57, a Democrat, said New York should lead the way in solving urgent social problems, just as it had opened up the heartland two centuries ago by digging the Erie Canal and, in his own first year in office, had become the biggest state to allow same-sex marriage at that time.Yet the expansive ambitions laid out by Mr. Cuomo in his inaugural address stood in contrast to the undeniable achievements of his first term, when he grappled with issues, like property taxes and gun control, that were important but held little mystery as to their solutions, which in many cases could be imported from other states.On Thursday, Mr. Cuomo called on lawmakers and ordinary New Yorkers to summon the courage to tackle broader problems, ones with neither obvious nor easy solutions, like reviving the upstate economy and addressing “chronic high poverty” in urban areas from the South Bronx to Rochester.Citing the killings of unarmed black men by police officers on Staten Island and in Ferguson, Mo., he said that some people had lost faith in the American system of criminal justice, and that it was New York’s obligation to produce reforms.Alluding to the blindfold worn by Lady Justice, the governor said, “Too many people are questioning if the blindfold is still intact — or does the justice system now see black and white, or black and blue, or rich and poor?”He said the American education system, which once lifted up immigrants, had now split into two, “one for the rich and one for the poor,” and needed improvement.And Mr. Cuomo appropriated themes espoused by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who won election railing against what he called New York City’s “tale of two cities.” The governor lamented the wide gap between the rich and the poor and the lack of opportunity faced by hard-working people yearning for upward mobility.“It’s time to be bold, my friends, because there is no small solution to big problems,” the governor said.Mr. Cuomo, whose re-election in November fell short of a coronation, celebrated his inauguration on the 64th floor of 1 World Trade Center, the newly completed downtown skyscraper, with the spiked elegance of Manhattan spread below.He held a second ceremony later on Thursday at a museum in Buffalo, the home of Mr. Cuomo’s new lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, a former member of Congress.In his address in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo expressed confidence in New York’s ability to take on big challenges. He told the story of the construction of the Erie Canal and invoked the state’s leadership on issues like women’s suffrage and the gay rights movement, as well as two of the defining achievements of his first term: legalizing same-sex marriage and tightening gun laws after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn.ImageGov. Andrew M. Cuomo was inaugurated for a second term in Manhattan on Thursday.Credit...Pool photo by Craig RuttleThose votes showed Mr. Cuomo at his most skillful, seeing, and then seizing, an opening, something he suggested he would do in the weeks to come on the issue of criminal justice reform.“He is very astute at reading public priorities, and he’s very fleet of foot,” said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College. “He thinks about how to play the game all the time, and so he’s a master of it.”As Mr. Cuomo promised to confront big challenges on Thursday, he offered little hint as to how.While he will provide more concrete proposals in his State of the State address next week, the daunting nature of the work he promised to tackle was a departure from past years. In his first term, he showed his mechanical mastery of Albany’s levers of power, but only sparingly tackled intractable societal issues.Robert J. Bellafiore, who was a senior aide to Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, said Mr. Cuomo now faced the challenge of determining how he defines vast issues like inequality, and what concrete steps he can take to address them.“As everybody’s mom always told them, actions speak louder than words,” he said, “and it’s the actual follow-up that will decide whether today is just a good moment, or something that carries into 2015 and his whole second term.”In fact, at times in his first term, Mr. Cuomo seemed to struggle to produce big ideas. Others seemed reverse-engineered from the news releases his office created to trumpet them.Almost on a whim, Mr. Cuomo proposed building the nation’s largest convention center in Queens, a plan that quickly crumbled. He put enormous energy into expanding casino gambling in upstate New York, even as analysts predicted the economic benefits would not live up to the governor’s hype. He is building a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River, but has not explained how the state will pay for it.Mr. Cuomo would very likely need to deploy all of the political skill he has honed over a lifetime to solve the problems he delineated on Thursday. Yet in his first term he sometimes entangled himself with his own restless maneuvering. After a series of scandals involving legislators, he tried to burnish his image as a corruption fighter by forming an investigative panel, called a Moreland Commission, to unearth malfeasance. But Mr. Cuomo meddled with the commission’s work and then shut it down prematurely, and federal prosecutors began their own investigation of his conduct. The episode became the biggest blemish on his record.At other times, Mr. Cuomo has contradicted himself. He promised not to extend a tax surcharge on high earners, but then agreed to create a new high-income tax bracket. He broke his promise to veto gerrymandered redistricting maps drawn by legislators to aid them in their re-election bids. He told the Working Families Party, a group of liberal activists and labor unions, that he would push for Democrats to take control of the State Senate, then barely lifted a finger to help them.And sometimes Mr. Cuomo has contradicted his contradictions. He traveled to Binghamton in 2013 to trumpet the virtues of building a casino in the area, then said last month that a casino would not cure the region’s economic woes, then reversed course nine days later and called for a casino to be located there.The constant motion can sometimes undermine Mr. Cuomo’s credibility: This week, he vetoed a bill that his own office had drafted.All along, Mr. Cuomo showed little interest in ideas from others, an insularity that frustrated some lawmakers.“Great leaders incorporate other ideas, or are willing to listen to other ideas,” said the Assembly minority leader, Brian M. Kolb, a Republican from Canandaigua. On Thursday, though, Mr. Cuomo’s eloquence in setting what could be an arduous agenda evoked memories of the man under whom he studied.Mr. Cuomo said he had spent New Year’s Eve with his father, who served three terms, and had gone through his speech with him Wednesday night.“He said it was good,” the governor recalled, “especially for a second-termer.”",2015-01-01T17:07:49+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/cuomo-inaugurated-for-second-term-as-governor.html,1330,1
New York Times,"Douglas Durst recalled the last time he saw and spoke with his troubled older brother, Robert. It was on a short bus ride 13 years ago, a shuttle taking members of the fabulously rich Durst family to a wedding reception at the St. Regis Hotel in Houston. Beneath the sheen of that festive moment, decades of torment crackled between Robert and Douglas, two of the groom’s uncles, then in their late 50s. That tension is central to a largely untold narrative of one of modern New York’s most prominent real estate families, a story that echoes with sibling rivalry as old as humankind. With Robert about to tell his version in a new documentary, Douglas has spoken publicly for the first time, concerned that his brother, at age 71, is on the verge of opening up a new attack on the family. They fought as boys, scuffling and punching through childhood. As young men, working in the offices where the family presided over billions of dollars in Manhattan real estate, Robert kept a sharp-pointed plumber’s wrench on his desk. Douglas responded by positioning a piece of pipe — “to protect myself,” he said — on his own desk. Eventually, their father, Seymour Durst, removed Robert as his designated successor in running the family’s empire and replaced him with Douglas, who had just turned 50. That was in 1994. To make the change, a team of lawyers had to revise dozens of legal documents governing the family trusts. The swap was made, Douglas Durst said, after Robert urinated in an uncle’s wastebasket. By the day of the wedding in Houston, Sept. 22, 2001, Robert had been on the run for most of a year, an uncharged suspect in the disappearance of his first wife and the killing of a woman who was his closest confidante. He surfaced a few days before the family gathering, long after ceasing contact with most relatives.“I was sitting in the bus and he walked on and sat almost directly behind me,” Douglas Durst said in December. “He was obviously very disturbed. I was just hoping to be able to walk off the bus.”He did. A week later, Robert Durst chopped up the body of a neighbor in one of his hide-outs, an apartment he rented for $300 a month in Galveston. Mr. Durst had been living there, disguised sometimes as a mute woman and other times as the male friend of the supposed woman. He would later be acquitted of murder, claiming the man had died in an accidental shooting; he served time for bail jumping and other lesser charges.Until now, Douglas Durst — a man of few words, great wealth and dynastic power over Manhattan real estate — has said virtually nothing in public about his brother, their relationship or his views about whether Robert was involved in the unsolved disappearance of his wife and the murder of his friend. ImageRobert Durst in Manhattan Criminal Court last month. He was acquitted after a two-day bench trial on charges of trespassing on property owned by his estranged family, including the West 43rd Street residence of his brother Douglas.Credit...Mike Segar/ReutersIn recent years, Robert has twice appeared at Douglas’s home in Westchester County, once while carrying two guns, another time in a ski mask.“There’s no doubt in my mind that if he had the opportunity to kill me, he would,” Douglas Durst said.Yet it is not worries about a physical threat that has prompted Douglas to speak now, he said, but what he believes will be a violent broadside against the family name and history: In coming weeks, HBO plans to broadcast a six-part documentary, “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst.” It draws on 25 hours of interviews with Robert Durst.Douglas Durst, 70, has not seen it. Nor did he agree to be interviewed by the filmmakers, Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling, despite repeated entreaties. Nevertheless, he believes that the series will be rooted in an untrustworthy source.“Bob is incapable of telling the truth,” Douglas Durst said. “He is a true psychopath, beyond any emotions. That’s why he does things, so he can experience the emotions that other people have vicariously. Because he has absolutely none of his own.”Through his lawyer, Robert Durst was invited to discuss the matters raised by his brother, but declined. “Bob appreciates the opportunity to speak with you, but he’s not going to do so at this time,” the lawyer, Steven M. Rabinowitz, wrote in an email. ROBERT DURST has had improbable success in mounting his version of reality at critical moments. He was able to convince a Texas jury that he was not legally responsible for the death of the man whose body he dismembered in 2001. Caught on videotape in 2012 and 2013 lurking around the homes of Durst family members in Manhattan from which he had been barred, he and his lawyer were still able to persuade a judge last month to acquit him of trespass by maintaining that Mr. Durst did not know which specific properties were owned by the family. Afterward, he told Charles V. Bagli of The New York Times that he had once managed those very buildings.Often, Douglas said, it was hard to discern any rationale for Robert’s behavior or fabrications. As a child, he pretended to be in the school band, even bringing home a tuba, but simply hid it among trees when he was going to school. He claimed to have two doctoral degrees, but did not. When he jumped bail in the Texas murder case, he used elaborate ruses to travel across the country incognito, but was arrested in a Pennsylvania supermarket, trying to shoplift a sandwich, a Band-Aid and a newspaper. He had $500 cash in his pocket, and was receiving income of about $2 million a year from a family trust.Years earlier, working in the rent-arrears department of the family business, he siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself, according to Douglas, who said Robert had tried to enlist his help in creating a ghost payroll operation to generate more cash. “From the family, it was just a bizarre thing to do, because they would have just given him the money,” Douglas said. When Douglas showed Seymour Durst the bank accounts with the stolen money, he instructed Robert not to do it anymore, according to Douglas.ImageRobert Durst in the late 1970s or early 1980s.Credit...Archives of Seymour DurstSometimes, the true hue of events involving Robert could take years to emerge.One involved a dog named Igor — actually, seven of them, according to Douglas.Robert and his first wife, Kathie Durst, ran a health food store in Vermont before returning to New York, where they kept several residences, including one near Douglas Durst’s home in Westchester.Kathie Durst, a medical student, disappeared in 1982, after her marriage with Robert Durst had become chronically contentious. She is now presumed dead. At the time, Douglas said, he suspected his brother had been involved but was uncertain. The authorities have never charged him.“Even though he wasn’t my favorite person in the whole world, it was hard for me to believe — to completely believe — that he had killed her,” he said.But his suspicion hardened into certainty, he said, with the 2001 death of the man in Texas, Morris Black, and the murder in December 2000 of his brother’s confidante, Susan Berman. No one has been charged in her killing.That, Douglas Durst said, was when he came up with a theory about the peculiar matter of his brother’s dogs in late 1981, just before Kathie Durst vanished in January 1982.“Before the disappearance of my sister-in-law, Bob had a series of Alaskan Malamutes, which is like a husky,” Douglas Durst said. “He had seven of them, and they all died, mysteriously, of different things, within six months of his owning them. All of them named Igor. We don’t know how they died, and what happened to their bodies.“In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing his wife with those dogs.”What led him to that conclusion, Douglas said, was that Robert turned the word “Igor” into a verb and inflected it with a menace: “When he was in jail in Pennsylvania, he was recorded saying, ‘I want to Igor Douglas.’""Mr. Durst said he refused many times to be interviewed for the documentary because the same filmmakers had previously made a feature film based on the Dursts, “All Good Things,” which he believed distorted the truth, and would not give him assurances that the HBO series would not be twisted by his brother’s fabrications.ImageRobert Durst's first wife, Kathie, who vanished in 1982, is presumed dead. Douglas Durst says he is certain that his brother killed her.Credit...G. Paul Burnett/The New York TimesMr. Jarecki, who has spent much of the last decade pursuing the Durst story, said last week that he had offered to go through his research with Douglas Durst and genuinely wanted to include his perspective in the documentary.“I’ve said to him many times before, and say now, we’re glad to show him the materials we’re working with,” Mr. Jarecki said.The series is only weeks from airing, he said, and is in the final phases of editing. “We would interrupt the edit now, meet him at a time and place of his choosing,” he said.Mr. Durst said that was not going to happen. “While I cannot choose my brother, I can choose who interviews me,” he said.As an example of why he distrusts Mr. Jarecki, Mr. Durst noted that in “All Good Things,” he was portrayed as using his clout to set up a private meeting with the Westchester district attorney in an apparent attempt to shut down the investigation into the disappearance of his brother’s wife. In fact, Mr. Durst said, in early 2004 he did meet by himself with the prosecutor, Jeanine Pirro, but the circumstances were different than those depicted in the film.Ms. Pirro “arranged for the meeting,” Douglas Durst said.“She told me,” he continued, “that based on what happened in Texas, Bob was not smart enough to make his wife disappear, and I must have helped him. I told her that if I had any way of getting my brother behind bars, I would do everything I could, but there was nothing I could do.”Ms. Pirro, who has left public office and now has a show on the Fox News Channel, did not dispute that she had arranged the meeting, but scoffed at Mr. Durst’s account. She declined to answer specific questions. AT the crux of his distress over the documentary, Mr. Durst said, is what he fears will be a false portrayal of the brothers’ father, relying on Robert’s narrative.“I see him getting a megaphone to spout his lies and his distortions about my father, about his relationship to the family and about the family’s history,” Mr. Durst said. “He’s saying that my father was domineering, that he pushed him to go into the business, and that Seymour didn’t love him. All that’s completely the opposite of the truth. Seymour never pushed anyone to join the family business, and he loved Robert very much.”ImageSeymour B. Durst in 1969. He died in 1995, less than six months after his older son, Robert, stopped communicating with him.Credit...Neal Boenzi/The New York TimesAs evidence of the esteem, Mr. Durst described how he came to inherit his father’s position as the leader of the trusts that controlled the family real estate holdings. The business was started by Joseph Durst, who immigrated to the United States in 1902. Two of Joseph’s sons, Seymour and David, were the trustees until the early 1990s. Around the time Robert, the oldest child, turned 18 in 1962, he had been designated by Seymour as his successor.Robert intermittently worked in the business, showing up at the office late in the day or after everyone else had gone home. He often spoke aloud to himself, a disconcerting practice that accelerated over the years. Douglas, who had started a family when he was young, gave up plans to become an urban economist in order to join the business, too. One evening in the early 1990s, catching up on correspondence after returning from a vacation, Douglas said, he filled his wastebasket with paper. When he tried to empty it, he felt something wet. There was urine in it.“I asked the cleaning staff the next day, and they said, ‘It’s your brother, and he does it frequently,’” Mr. Durst recalled. “So I went to my father and uncles and complained, knowing exactly what they would say. Which was, ‘Maybe he had to go.’ Nothing happened until he peed in my uncle’s wastepaper basket. Then he had a stern talking-to. He stopped peeing in wastepaper baskets.”But there was another, more profound response. “One result of the wastepaper basket incident was I was able to convince my uncles to name me as the successor trustee,” Douglas said. That did not dilute Robert’s share of the trusts, but shifted control to Douglas.How Robert would react to the change was a source of anxiety to Seymour Durst. “He’d had many discussions with me about how he was going to talk to Bob about this,” Douglas Durst said. “That, like any older brother, that he would be slighted by the younger brother stepping up, so to speak.”There were two Durst trusts, each naming 13 grandchildren of Joseph — that is, Douglas, his siblings and cousins. The torch passed to Douglas on his 50th birthday, Dec. 19, 1994. That week, Robert did not show up for a regular family lunch at Osteria al Doge on West 44th Street. When the others returned to work, they discovered that he had cleared out his office and set up a mail drop and a phone elsewhere. Robert did not communicate with his father again.“When Bob stopped talking to him, Seymour was brokenhearted,” Douglas said. “He kept trying to find ways to get him to speak to him.”Seymour Durst had a stroke four and a half months later. “He was in the hospital for six days, and my sister tried very hard to get Bob to go visit,” Douglas said. “Finally, Bob did go. My father kept holding on until Bob did go.”Did Seymour Durst have any awareness at that point? “The doctors would tell you no, but I’m just telling you what happened,” Douglas said. “He dies the next morning, a couple of hours after.”In 2006, Robert Durst accepted $65 million for his interest in the family trust and no longer has any legal claim to it. Last month, after winning the trespassing case in New York, Mr. Durst pleaded no contest to urinating on the checkout display at a CVS store in Texas and paid a $500 fine.Upset as Douglas Durst is about the documentary, he detected a mordantly bright side.“I am pretty certain that until the series is over,” Mr. Durst said, “he is not going to kill me.”",2015-01-01T17:25:51+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/series-on-troubled-scion-of-durst-real-estate-family-has-critic-his-brother.html,2430,1
New York Times,"Just minutes before the New Year’s Eve ball dropped in Times Square, three members of a family in Queens died in a fire that started in the kitchen of their ninth-floor apartment in the LeFrak City housing complex, officials said on Thursday.The police identified the victims as Louise Jean-Charles, 59; her husband, Napoleon Michel, 69; and their niece, Nadia Donnay, 37. All three lived in the apartment, which is in an 18-story building at 96-02 57th Avenue in Corona, the police said.Fire marshals were still investigating the cause of the two-alarm blaze on Thursday, officials said, but it was not deemed suspicious.

Officials said they did not deem the blaze suspicious.Credit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesThe officials said the apartment lacked smoke detectors. A spokesman for LeFrak said that the building had no fire violations and that the apartment was outfitted with smoke detectors as required by law, adding, “A smoke detector rider attesting to the presence of this life safety equipment was signed and initialed by the tenant in 2012.”Most of the fire was contained in the apartment, though smoke did spread through the building, said James Long, a spokesman for the New York Fire Department. The building was not evacuated, Mr. Long said. More than 100 firefighters responded to the blaze.Three hours later, around 3 a.m., the police reported the city’s first murder of 2015.A 26-year-old Bronx man, identified as Herb Huntley, was found in the lobby of 671 Westchester Avenue, a building at the St. Mary’s Houses, with gunshot wounds to his head and torso, officials said. Mr. Huntley, who lived on Tinton Avenue in the Bronx, was taken by emergency responders to Lincoln Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The police said that no one had been arrested in the case but that the investigation was continuing.On Wednesday, shortly after 6 p.m., a woman identified as Guler Ugur-Yaacobi, 44, of Brooklyn, was struck and killed by a black S.U.V. while crossing Amsterdam Avenue at 113th Street, the police said. The car had a green light, the police said, but kept going north on Amsterdam after the collision.

New York Times,"More than 76,000 people died in Syria’s civil war in 2014, including more than 3,500 children, a monitoring group reported on Thursday. The figures would make last year the deadliest in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011.The figures from the monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, put the total number of dead in the conflict as of Wednesday at 206,603.The group, based in Britain, uses a network of contacts inside Syria to tally casualties, and its figures cannot be independently corroborated. The United Nations, which once regularly documented the numbers of dead and wounded in Syria, discontinued the practice some time ago.But the United Nations said in December that more than 200,000 people had been killed in the conflict, which began as an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad and has since evolved into a civil war that has destabilized the Middle East.The Syrian Observatory’s 2014 casualty figures include 17,790 civilians, among them 3,501 children.The rest include Syrian soldiers and allied militia members, rebel fighters and members of jihadist militant organizations that have joined the fighting.The Historic Scale of Syria’s Refugee CrisisDramatic images from the Syrian refugee crisis, which exploded to encompass six million people by October 2013.The Syrian Observatory’s total of 76,021 deaths for 2014 compared with its total of 73,447 in 2013, 49,294 in 2012 and 7,841 in 2011.The number of wounded in the Syria conflict has been even harder to determine, partly because of restricted access to combat zones and the collapse of the country’s public health system.Last month, the World Health Organization’s Syria representative, Elizabeth Hoff, said the cumulative number of wounded was approximately one million.Ms. Hoff made the estimate as part of a United Nations annual appeal for funding at a donors conference in Berlin. The organization said it was seeking $8.4 billion in 2015 to help nearly 18 million victims of Syria’s conflict, mostly displaced civilians and refugees.The 2014 casualty figures were issued as Syria’s state-run news agency reported that Mr. Assad, in a New Year’s Eve morale-boosting gesture, had visited soldiers on the front lines in Jobar, an embattled suburb of Damascus. Images posted on the news agency’s website showed Mr. Assad, minus his signature mustache, greeting his troops.Antigovernment activists said that they doubted that Mr. Assad had ventured into Jobar, which they said was contested or rebel-controlled, and that the images shown by the state media appeared to be from Zablatani, a government-held area nearby.Some images showed a building with a sign that read Damascus Transportation Department, and several Damascus residents said they knew of such a building in Zablatani, not in Jobar.",2015-01-01T18:44:51+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/middleeast/syrian-civil-war-2014-deadliest-so-far.html,424,4
New York Times,"ISTANBUL — The Turkish police arrested an armed man on Thursday after he tried to attack a palace complex near the prime minister’s office in Istanbul.The man, who is suspected of being a member of a terrorist organization, threw two homemade grenades at police officers in front of the Dolmabahce Palace. When the bombs failed to detonate, he tried to shoot at the officers with a gun, the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency reported. No injuries have been reported.Dolmabahce Palace was once the residence of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.It was not immediately clear whether Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was in his office at the time of the attempted attack.Istanbul’s police chief, Selami Altinok, told reporters that the assailant was a former convict and a suspected terrorist, who was imprisoned from 2003 to 2006. He did not disclose the charges against the man or reveal his identity because an investigation was still underway.“Two hand grenades that he hurled against the police on duty did not explode,” Mr. Altinok said. “He was quickly overpowered.”The man was found to be carrying an automatic weapon and a pistol, but security forces in the area quickly mobilized and seized the weapons, local news media reported.",2015-01-01T18:55:13+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/europe/turkey-police-thwart-attack-on-prime-ministers-office.html,207,10
New York Times,"John I. Goodlad, an influential educator whose study of more than 27,000 students, teachers and administrators in the late 1970s and early ’80s documented the problems plaguing American public schools, died on Nov. 29 in Seattle. He was 94.The cause was cancer, his son, Stephen, said.Professor Goodlad, who taught for many years at the University of Washington and had earlier been dean of the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Los Angeles, was a progressive education reformer in the tradition of John Dewey. Many of his views — on the importance of early childhood education, for example, or on the need for better teacher training — remain central to the educational reform agenda.He was best known for his comprehensive eight-year study involving classes from kindergarten through 12th grade in 38 schools in 13 communities. The project, sponsored by the Institute for the Development of Educational Activities, an independent research organization, and conducted with the help of more than 40 other researchers, published its findings in 1983.The picture it painted, The New York Times reported at the time, was “a world of talky teachers and uninterested students, who work in a context of unclear goals and serious social and educational inequities.”The study and a 1984 book by Professor Goodlad that grew out of it, “A Place Called School,” resonated widely in policy circles, in part because it appeared so closely on the heels of “A Nation at Risk,” the 1983 report by a presidential commission that concluded that American education was threatened by a rising tide of mediocrity.“John’s most powerful teaching was that school is a moral enterprise, not just a matter of getting the right techniques and organizational structure,” said Jeannie Oakes, who worked with Mr. Goodlad on the school study and is now an emeritus education professor at U.C.L.A. “There has to be an understanding that schooling is central to our democracy, that teachers are responsible not only for the academic development of their students, but their social development and their development as citizens.”John Inkster Goodlad was born on Aug. 19, 1920, in North Vancouver, British Columbia, and grew up in a mountain community nearby. He began his teaching career in a one-room schoolhouse with 34 children across eight grades, an experience that shaped many of his ideas, his son said. He came to see grade levels as arbitrary markers devised for adult convenience.“He could see that the kids were really great at helping other kids learn, across the grade levels,” Stephen Goodlad said. “And he saw that just because you were at a certain age or grade level didn’t mean you were functioning at a certain level. What he saw there showed him that we had a system that didn’t make much sense.”Professor Goodlad proposed a radically new model of schools, in which elementary school students would not be divided into specific grades and their work would not be graded.He opposed tracking students by their skill levels, and he suggested that teachers should have a career path that, with experience and a doctoral degree, could lead to higher-paying jobs as a master teacher, working with professionals who were newer to the classroom.At the University of Washington, Professor Goodlad and two other professors, Roger Soder and Kenneth Sirotnik, founded the Center for Educational Renewal to promote collaboration between schools and teacher-training institutions.In 1992, the year after he retired from the university, Professor Goodlad founded an offshoot, the Institute for Educational Inquiry, which is devoted to strengthening the role of education in maintaining democracy.In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Mary Paula Kamp, and five grandsons. His wife, Evalene, died in 2006.“I have pondered for decades how he kept going, fighting the same fights over and over,” Stephen Goodlad said of his father. “I would have torn out my hair, or gone fishing.”Professor Goodlad, incidentally, often did just that, his son said. He was an avid salmon fisherman at his summer home in the San Juan Islands of Washington State.Professor Goodlad was hopeful but also realistic about changing how schools teach, and in a long career at the forefront of educational reform he learned lessons of his own.“One of the things you learn is that good things keep recycling,” he said in 1993 in an interview with Technos Quarterly, a journal about the use of technology in education. “If it’s a good idea that doesn’t make it this time, it’ll make it next time.“The other thing that you learn — and it’s discouraging — is that you’re always getting newcomers on the scene for the recycling process,” he continued. “That means the process of educational change and improvement never ends, because you’re always dealing with a new clientele, a new group of parents, a new group of administrators, a new group of teachers, and so on.“Third, and most important,” he said, “would be that it doesn’t matter how many bills you pass and how many policies you lay down from on high — when it comes right down to it, the individual school has an incredible capacity for rejecting it passively or taking it on and doing something about it.”",2015-01-01T21:44:02+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/us/john-i-goodlad-educator-who-led-8-year-study-underpinning-school-reforms-dies-at-94.html,876,11
New York Times,"THE MELT method — a kind of body work that has been the subject of gym classes and a best-selling book — claims to address a host of middle-age complaints: chronic pain, aching joints, weight gain, stress, wrinkles, digestive problems, low energy and insomnia. Eager to cross at least some of those off my list, I showed up at the JCC in Manhattan one morning for a class led by Sue Hitzmann, who also happens to have developed MELT. With my soft MELT roller and a small rubber ball in hand, I waited while the room filled. Ms. Hitzmann’s story is one of disillusionment with mainstream medicine. About 10 years ago she was a star fitness instructor in her late 20s with a thriving neuromuscular therapy practice. She suddenly developed severe pain in her right heel that doctors and physical therapists could neither explain nor cure. They told her it was “all in her head,” she said, and suggested she find a psychiatrist. Undeterred, she went into research mode and discovered the emerging science of connective tissue, or fascia. Researchers describe connective tissue as a three-dimensional, fluid-filled support network that surrounds the muscles, bones, nerves and organs. As we age, our bodies endure wear and tear that is thought to result in dehydration of this system. Even in young people, repetitive motions like running can compress and dry out the fascia, creating areas of what Ms. Hitzmann calls “stuck stress.” Sedentary behaviors can have the same effect. Ms. Hitzmann developed a self-treatment system to manipulate and rehydrate the connective tissue. (MELT stands for Myofascial Energetic Length Technique.) Once you learn the method, she said, just 10 minutes three times a week is all you need. MELT now has 1,300 instructors nationwide and a following that includes the Olympic snowboarder Jamie Anderson, who used the method on her feet before winning gold in Sochi, Russia. Ms. Hitzmann’s book on the system, “The MELT Method,” was published in 2013 by HarperOne. In class, Ms. Hitzmann first led us through foot exercises. We began by standing with our feet hip-width apart and our eyes closed. We raised all 10 toes, took three breaths and then lowered them to the floor. If we felt our bodies drifting forward as our toes touched the ground, she said, it was a sign that our connective tissue system was out of whack. Next we placed a ball under one foot, pressing down with each toe knuckle. Then we moved the ball back and forth over different points on the arch and heel. Finally, we assessed our progress by standing on both feet and determining if that leg felt different. Amazingly, I felt a change. After doing the other foot, we repeated the toe lifting and lowering — this time, no forward drift. Three more sequences followed, all performed while lying on our backs on a mat. First we assessed: Were there parts of our backs and legs not touching the mat? If the bra line was not touching (mine wasn’t) and the neck felt restricted when moving the head back and forth, that meant trouble in the shoulder girdle. If a large part of the lower back was off the mat, that meant a problem with the diaphragm. If the backs of the thighs weren’t touching (mine weren’t), the pelvis was the culprit. We placed the soft roller under our spines, rocked back and forth on the mat, then did a pelvis tilt and tuck. We focused on the diaphragm, breathing in deeply as we rested our spines on the roller, then exhaling forcefully. Again, we rested flat on our backs without the roller and assessed. This time my bra line and the backs of my thighs were touching the mat, and my neck felt looser as I moved my head from side to side. Finally, we used the roller to focus on the calves, the thighs and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. The goal was to gently massage any tender areas and to get the fluid moving again in the fascia. As class ended, I felt oddly lighter and more energized. A fellow student, Constance Boykan, 73, said MELT had helped her low back and pelvic pain. “But it doesn’t last,” she said. “That’s frustrating.” By the time I’d walked a few blocks to my subway entrance, I knew what she meant. The feeling was gone. But I was already planning my next MELT session. ",2015-01-01T22:06:54+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/arts/a-class-in-the-melt-method-of-body-work.html,740,28
New York Times,"Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has resigned from each of his corporate and nonprofit board positions, an aide confirmed Thursday, the latest indication that he is moving toward starting a presidential campaign.Mr. Bush, a Republican, gave up positions at an online education firm, his own education foundation and his post on the board of Michael R. Bloomberg’s philanthropic foundation this week, the latest nonpolitical commitments from which he has detached himself as he looks toward the 2016 race.Last month, he severed ties with Barclays, the London-based bank where he had made more than $1 million a year as a consultant, and stepped down from the boards of two other corporations, Tenet Healthcare and Rayonier, a timberland and real estate concern.“This is a natural next step as he turns his focus toward political activity in the new year,” said Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush.In a Facebook post last month, Mr. Bush announced that he was “actively exploring” a White House bid and setting up a political organization to raise money for his travel and expanding his staff.He has already begun the process of adding fund-raising and legal advisers, and some of his backers are also considering the creation of a “super PAC” on Mr. Bush’s behalf.Though Mr. Bush has not committed to a campaign yet, his step to cut ties with his outside financial and nonprofit positions, which was first reported by The Washington Post, is a sign to Republican donors and activists that he is seriously considering the race. In addition to the education groups, Mr. Bush also left the board of the Bloomberg Family Foundation this week. Mr. Bloomberg informed the board Wednesday of Mr. Bush’s departure.What Mr. Bush has not done yet, however, is engage much with potential Republican primary voters. Unlike most of his potential intraparty rivals, he has spent little time in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that start the presidential nominating process.He will not attend the Iowa Freedom Summit, a gathering hosted by Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, next month. A number of likely candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, have committed to attending the forum, one of the first high-profile events for Republican White House prospects.Mr. Bush and his son Jeb. Jr. still work together at Jeb Bush and Associates, a business consulting firm in Coral Gables, Fla. The former governor also retains a stake in Britton Hill Partnership, the business vehicle he has used to set up private equity investments in the past two years.An aide said he was reviewing these commitments, but was not immediately moving to detach himself because they are not part of a larger enterprise and therefore are more reliant on his involvement.Working in real estate, he had a net worth of about $2 million when he was elected governor in 1998. After leaving office, he earned money through his consulting work, directorships and by delivering paid speeches.Mr. Bush’s biggest passion in his post-governor years, however, may be his work on education reform efforts through the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which he founded and until this week headed.An aide said he left the foundation because they have an excellent board and staff in place, and he was concerned about “a time commitment” given his coming political activity.",2015-01-01T22:43:20+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/us/politics/jeb-bush-resigns-from-board-seats-possibly-edging-closer-to-presidential-run.html,559,13
New York Times,"GUANTÁNAMO, Cuba — At a military checkpoint on the road that approaches the American naval base here, one of three along the way, four Cuban soldiers in pea-green fatigues, without guns, stood on duty last Sunday laughing over a joke in the shade of an almond tree, beside a neatly cultivated flower bed. A large sign declared the site “the first anti-imperialist trench.”They stopped the few cars that approached and asked to see the special passes required for access to Caimanera, the town that once served as the gateway to the United States military base across Guantánamo Bay.“Because this is an area of high sensitivity for defense, everyone needs a pass,” said one of the soldiers, a first lieutenant named Gamboa, turning back a reporter from The New York Times. Passes usually take 72 hours to approve, he said, and on a Sunday it was certainly impossible to get one.Despite the sudden thaw in relations between the United States and Cuba, the base here remains a sore point for Cubans, a deeply felt grievance that the Castros, first Fidel and now his brother Raúl, have long pointed to as a stinging symbol of American imperialism.A senior State Department official in Washington said that Cuban negotiators had raised their government’s oft-repeated demand for the return of the base during the secret talks that culminated in last month’s surprise announcement that the two countries would re-establish full diplomatic relations.“It’s logical that the Cubans would raise it,” the official said, adding, however, that it did not become a focus of the talks. “These were more intensive conversations than we’ve had in a long time, but it’s also true that Guantánamo comes up all the time, even in our migration talks, as a principled issue for the Cubans.”Here in Guantánamo, a city of about 216,000 people, with a prosperous-looking downtown and decrepit back streets, residents have repeatedly been reminded over the years that they stand virtually face to face with the enemy.“It’s a little bit delicate,” said Geny Jarrosay, 25, an art student who has created several pieces based on the complex, sometimes tense relations between the base and the city of Guantánamo, where he grew up. “Coexisting with it is like having a person you don’t like living in your house for 50 years, and you’ve gotten used to both the good and the bad.”But the base gives Cuba, an island nation, a sort of de facto land border, and a hostile one at that.“We’re very conscious that it’s American territory even though it’s not,” Mr. Jarrosay said. “It’s Cuban territory.”For a video and photo project he completed this year, Mr. Jarrosay says he obtained some dirt from the base — he won’t say how — and on a bus trip across Cuba tossed it out the window a little bit at a time.“It was like returning the soil to Cuba,” he said.It might be said that the Guantánamo base is the last fruit of America’s original sin in Cuba — its 1898 invasion in the midst of the island’s war of independence from Spain. A peace treaty ending the Spanish-American War in 1898 installed the United States as the island’s administrator, which it remained until 1902, when Washington allowed Cuba to govern itself.But the price was the hated Platt Amendment, a series of conditions written into the Cuban Constitution that gave the United States sway over Cuban affairs and the right to establish naval bases there. In 1903, the open-ended lease for the base at Guantánamo was signed.For many years, the city of Guantánamo and nearby towns like Caimanera were closely linked to the base. Many residents worked there, and American troops disported in the local brothels and bars.But after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, the base became a symbol of American highhandedness and a point of repeated friction. Cuba refuses to cash the checks sent by the United States to pay the annual rent of $4,085.A Decades-Long Thaw in U.S.-Cuba Relations17 PhotosView Slide Show ›Roberto SalasWhen the Bush administration built a prison on the base to house captured terrorism suspects after 9/11, Cuba strenuously objected. Later reports of brutal treatment of prisoners there deepened Cuba’s ire.After taking office in 2009 President Obama ordered the closing of the prison. But he has not been able to carry out his pledge, and the prison remains a bitter symbol of frustration and unfulfilled promises, and what many critics call a stain on America’s reputation. Twenty-eight detainees were transferred from the prison to other countries last year, but 127 remain.Even after the prison is finally shut down, analysts say, it is unlikely that the base will be returned to Cuba any time soon.“This is an excellent moment to open up that question and ponder what that would mean for the United States and Cuba,” said Jana K. Lipman, an associate professor of history at Tulane University, who has written about the base. But she said that the political risks of returning it were great, recalling the experience of President Jimmy Carter when he negotiated the handover of the Panama Canal in the 1970s.“That was not a popular decision as far as public opinion was concerned,” Ms. Lipman said. “There was a lot of political spillback that the president had to deal with.” Nearly all the people interviewed here, whether they supported the Cuban government or opposed it, said the base should be returned to Cuba.“It’s Cuban territory; it doesn’t belong to” the United States, said Iliana Cotilla. She is a nurse who supplements her government salary by selling coffee and snacks from the front of her house, a business newly allowed under Cuba’s socialist system. “It’s a lack of respect to have that on our territory, to be abusing and torturing people there.”Periodic tensions aside, there is generally no day-to-day contact between Cubans and the base, which is several miles away and out of sight of the city of Guantánamo. The last two local residents who worked on the base retired in 2012.A resident of Caimanera, who lives within the restricted zone that requires a pass to enter, said that it was like living on the border between hostile countries, describing a sort of militarized gated community.Having a military base in the neighborhood does have its advantages, said the man, who spoke anonymously for fear of the authorities. “It’s very calm, it’s very controlled, and there is no crime or drugs,” he said. And residents get a cash bonus for living there.On a wooded hill just outside the city of Guantánamo, at a newly built tourist overlook with a 10-foot-high viewing platform and a restaurant, Néver Pérez, 48, and his wife, Licet Palomino, 45, gazed over Guantánamo Bay toward the base in the distance.Mr. Pérez, who is from Guantánamo but now lives in Orlando, Fla., having been a resident of the United States for 14 years, said that he hoped the new opening with the United States would lead to the return of the base. “If they have good relations I think they will give it back,” he said, dressed in a red, white and blue shirt patterned after the stars and stripes of the American flag.For a small fee, a government-paid guide, Yunior Leyva, 31, provided binoculars to visitors and pointed to what he said was a radar installation on top of a hill within the base, with structures looking like giant white mushrooms.Back in town, Clara Duany, 74, said that she worked on the base as a housekeeper from 1956 to 1960. She said that during Fidel Castro’s guerrilla war against the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, she smuggled medicine from the base to the rebels and had to take refuge on the base to escape capture by the government. Today, she is famous here as La India, the unpaid mascot for the local baseball team, the Indios del Guaso.Ms. Duany said she felt no rancor toward the Americans despite the government’s anti-imperialist sloganeering.“If they call me I will go work there again,” she said. In the choppy English she learned years ago on the base she said: “I liked every day. Everything. Yes, too much.”",2015-01-01T23:44:33+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/despite-thaw-american-base-at-guantanamo-still-stings-for-cubans.html,1371,4
New York Times,"The top two executives of the New York State Thruway Authority abruptly quit this week, the latest sign of turmoil at the agency as it faces a deep budget shortfall and difficulty financing the construction of a new Tappan Zee Bridge.The authority’s executive director, Thomas J. Madison, and its chief operating and financial officer, John M. Bryan, resigned without warning on Wednesday and surprised the authority’s board of directors, said Donna J. Luh, the acting chairwoman.“We were caught off guard like everyone else was,” Ms. Luh said during a telephone interview on Thursday. “Both have done a very good job.”Their departures followed the resignation in early December of Howard P. Milstein as chairman of the authority’s board and the announcement two weeks ago that the authority faced a deficit of $36 million for 2015.The New York Post, which first reported the resignations on Thursday, suggested that a coming report by the state inspector general’s office on the authority’s operations might have prompted the departures.Messages to the inspector general’s office were not returned on Thursday, the New Year’s Day holiday. Ms. Luh said she had no knowledge of the scope or focus of the report but was aware through news accounts that “one is obviously being compiled.”In an email to the Thruway staff on Wednesday, she suggested that the departures were “part of a natural transition of government” as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo begins his second term in office.The independent authority operates and maintains the Thruway’s 570 miles of highway, the Erie Canal and 809 bridges. Its biggest bridge — the Tappan Zee, which crosses the Hudson River between Rockland and Westchester Counties — is currently being replaced, a project championed by Mr. Cuomo.The governor’s plan to pay for the $3.9 billion project suffered a major setback in September, when the federal Environmental Protection Agency rejected most of the state’s request for a $511 million low-interest loan. The state had argued the project would enhance the environment, a position the federal agency rejected.The authority had already been contemplating toll increases throughout its network of bridges and roads. Without that federal financing, the state may have to sell more bonds to cover construction costs, taking on more debt that could result in even higher toll increases.The authority’s seven board members are appointed by the governor, with approval of the State Senate. Of the six current members, five were appointed before Mr. Cuomo took office. He chose both Mr. Madison and Mr. Milstein, a wealthy banker and real estate developer, for their posts in 2011.Mr. Cuomo’s office declined to comment on the latest departures.

Cuomo, the three-term governor of New York who commanded the attention of the country with a compelling public presence, a forceful defense of liberalism and his exhaustive ruminations about whether to run for president, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.His family confirmed the death, which occurred only hours after Mr. Cuomo’s son Andrew M. Cuomo was inaugurated in Manhattan for a second term as governor. The cause was heart failure.Mario Cuomo led New York during a turbulent time, 1983 through 1994. His ambitions for an activist government were thwarted by recession. He found himself struggling with the State Legislature not over what the government should do but over what programs should be cut, and what taxes should be raised, simply to balance the budget.Still, no matter the problems he found in Albany, Mr. Cuomo burst beyond the state’s boundaries to personify the liberal wing of his national party and become a source of unending fascination and, ultimately, frustration for Democrats, whose leaders twice pressed him to run for president, in 1988 and 1992, to no avail.In an era when liberal thought was increasingly discredited, Mr. Cuomo, a man of large intellect and often unrestrained personality, celebrated it, challenging Ronald Reagan at the height of his presidency with an expansive and affirmative view of government and a message of compassion, tinged by the Roman Catholicism that was central to Mr. Cuomo’s identity.A man of contradictions who enjoyed Socratic arguments with himself, Mr. Cuomo seemed to disdain politics even as he embraced it. “What an ugly business this is,” he liked to say. Yet he reveled in it, proving himself an uncommonly skilled politician and sometimes a ruthless one.He was a tenacious debater and a spellbinding speaker at a time when political oratory seemed to be shrinking to the size of the television set. Delivering the keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, he eclipsed his party’s nominee, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, seizing on Reagan’s description of America as “a shining city on a hill” to portray the president as unaware of impoverished Americans. “Mr. President,” he said, “you ought to know that this nation is more a ‘tale of two cities’ than it is just a ‘shining city on a hill.’ ”The speech was the high-water mark of his national political career, making him in many ways a more admired figure outside his state than in it.He enjoyed victories in New York. He closed the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island, ending a long and divisive fight over its potential dangers. He signed ethics legislation under a cloud of scandals involving state lawmakers and their employees.But he may be remembered more for the things he never did than for what he accomplished. His designs on the presidency became just flirtations. He encouraged President Bill Clinton to consider him for a seat on the Supreme Court but pulled back just as the offer was about to be made in 1993. For all his advocacy of an activist government, he did not always practice it, or could not, because of the fiscal obstacles he encountered in Albany.Always given to self-doubt and second-guessing, Mr. Cuomo said that if he had any regrets about his governorship, it was that he had never identified himself with a large initiative that might have been his legacy, as the expansion of the State University of New York was for Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.ImageGov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1994, campaigning from a bus.Credit...James Estrin/The New York TimesMr. Cuomo noted that he had built more prison cells than any chief executive in the state’s history. But he added, “What I didn’t do was pick one thing and keep saying it over and over again, so I could have gotten credit for it.”He had a pointed sense of humor. When an engine failed in a puff of smoke on a state-owned Gulfstream G-1 jet one morning with the governor aboard, he barely noticed, and kept talking about national politics until he noticed that a reporter across the way had stopped taking notes and had turned ashen. “What’s the matter?” he asked. “Aren’t you in a state of grace?”Mr. Cuomo served longer than any of his 51 predecessors except Rockefeller and, in the early years of the republic, George Clinton. He might have surpassed Rockefeller, but in seeking a fourth term in 1994, he was defeated by George E. Pataki, a little-known Republican state senator from Peekskill. Mr. Cuomo’s advisers had counseled him not to run again, but he overruled them.Andrew Cuomo, a former housing secretary under President Clinton, sought to become governor himself in 2002, but withdrew from the Democratic field amid an uproar over remarks he had made questioning Governor Pataki’s leadership after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He ran again in 2010 and was elected. It was a redemptive moment for the Cuomo family, and the first time in New York’s history that a father and son had been elected chief executive. Andrew Cuomo was handily re-elected in November.Mario Cuomo, a lawyer by profession, could trim his sails in the face of opposition, but he held to more than a few positions that went against the grain of public opinion. Most prominent was his opposition to the death penalty, an unpopular view that contributed to his defeat by Edward I. Koch in the 1977 mayoral primary in New York and that nearly derailed his first bid for governor. His annual veto of the death penalty became a rite, and he invoked it as a testimony to his character and principles.He was similarly resolute when he defied his church in 1984 by flying to the University of Notre Dame to proclaim that Roman Catholic politicians who personally opposed abortion, as he did, could appropriately support the right of a woman to have an abortion.Mr. Cuomo’s essentially liberal view of government never wavered, even after he effectively lost the argument when Democrats embraced the centrist Mr. Clinton. Years afterward, Mr. Cuomo would produce a copy of a speech he delivered to the progressive New Democratic Coalition in 1974, reading passages aloud with the same electric spirit and rolling cadences that had made him so evocative a speaker.In the end, two images of Mr. Cuomo endure. The first is of him, as governor, commanding the lectern at the 1984 Democratic convention, stilling a sea of delegates with his oratory. The second is of two chartered airplanes on the tarmac at the Albany airport in December 1991, waiting to fly him to New Hampshire to pay the $1,000 filing fee that would put his name on the state’s Democratic primary ballot for president.Mr. Cuomo, whose tortuous deliberations over whether to seek the White House had led pundits to call him “Hamlet on the Hudson,” put the decision off until 90 minutes before the 5 p.m. filing deadline. Then he emerged from the Executive Mansion to announce to a news conference at the Capitol that he would not run. The demands of negotiating a stalled state budget, he said, prevented him entering the race.“It seems to me I cannot turn my attention to New Hampshire while this threat hangs over the head of the New Yorkers that I’ve sworn to put first,” he said.That explanation failed to persuade even his closest friends, and in the years to come they would recall the two planes sitting forlornly on the tarmac as symbols of the governor’s unrealized promise.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/6:11-0:00transcriptCuomo at the 1984 Democratic ConventionAt the 1984 Democratic National Convention, then Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York delivered his famous “tale of two cities” keynote address.NAAt the 1984 Democratic National Convention, then Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York delivered his famous “tale of two cities” keynote address.First Love Was BaseballMario Matthew Cuomo was born in Queens on June 15, 1932, the fourth child of Andrea and Immaculata Cuomo. His parents, penniless and unable to speak English, had come to the United States from the province of Salerno, south of Naples, settling at first in Jersey City.Mario grew up in the Queens neighborhood of South Jamaica, where the family had moved and opened a grocery store. Mario worked in the store and on Saturdays served as the “Shabbos goy” for an Orthodox synagogue up the street, providing services as a non-Jew that the faithful were not allowed to do for themselves on the Sabbath. South Jamaica — an “Italian-black-German-Irish-Polish neighborhood,” as Mr. Cuomo described it — provided him with a career’s worth of anecdotes.It was baseball, not politics, that first engaged him, and he proved as aggressive in one as in the other. After graduating from St. John’s Preparatory School in Brooklyn in 1949, he played on the freshman baseball team at St. John’s University.A strapping six feet tall, 190 pounds at age 19, he signed a contract to play center field for the Class D Brunswick Pirates in Georgia in 1952, reportedly receiving a $2,000 signing bonus, sizable for that time. Mr. Cuomo “plays hard” and “will run over you if you get in his way,” a Pirates scout wrote.His baseball career was short-lived. Knocked in the head with a 3-and-2 fastball that summer, he was left blind for a week and forced to give up the game — leaving with a .244 batting average.Mr. Cuomo went back to St. John’s and graduated in 1953, having majored in Latin American studies, English and philosophy. By then he had settled on a law career and married Matilda N. Raffa, a fellow student. On a scholarship he enrolled in St. John’s Law School; while he studied there, his wife, who survives him, supported them as a teacher.Besides her and Andrew Cuomo, Mr. Cuomo is survived by four other children, Dr. Margaret I. Cuomo, Maria Cuomo Cole, Madeline Cuomo O’Donohue and Christopher Cuomo, a journalist at CNN; and 14 grandchildren.Mr. Cuomo’s first job in the law was as the confidential assistant to Judge Adrian P. Burke of the New York State Court of Appeals, which Mr. Cuomo would reshape 30 years later by appointing all seven members, including Judith S. Kaye, the first woman to serve as chief judge.His job with Judge Burke and his law school success — he graduated at the head of his class — led Mr. Cuomo to assume that in entering private practice he would have his pick of New York’s leading law firms. Instead, one after another rejected him, in his view because he was Italian-American. “I obviously am the original ethnic from Queens: my hands, my face, my voice, my inflections,” he said. One lawyer with whom he spoke suggested that he change his name to Mark Conrad, he said. The experience fed a lifelong disdain for anybody who struck Mr. Cuomo as elitist.He joined a Brooklyn law firm, Corner, Weisbrod, Froeb & Charles, in 1963 and entered public life the next year, when he took up the case of junkyard dealers whose property had been condemned; the planner Robert Moses wanted the land, 67 acres, to expand the site of the 1964 World’s Fair. Mr. Cuomo won a suit prohibiting the use of state funds for the project, and three years later the city decided against seizing the property for parkland.That victory brought him to the attention of 69 families facing eviction from their homes in a blue-collar Italian-American neighborhood in Corona, Queens, where the city wanted to build a school. Mr. Cuomo pressed the city and the courts into a compromise — a smaller school — that preserved 55 of the homes. And in 1972 Mayor John V. Lindsay recruited him to mediate a far more volatile city-neighborhood dispute, in Forest Hills, Queens, where middle-class families were trying to block construction of low-income public housing. Mr. Cuomo forged a compromise that cut the project in half.ImageThe Cuomo family in 1977, from left: Madeline, 13; Margaret, 22; Christopher, 7; Maria, 15; Mario; Matilda; and Andrew, 19.Credit...Tyrone Dukes/The New York TimesEntering Elective PoliticsHis successes impressed state Democratic leaders, and in 1974 Mr. Cuomo, at 42, entered elective politics as the party’s choice for lieutenant governor. He was challenged in a primary, however, by Mary Anne Krupsak, a state senator from upstate, who defeated him and was elected as the running mate of Hugh L. Carey, a Democratic congressman from Brooklyn.Mr. Carey, a fellow St. John’s alumnus, named Mr. Cuomo secretary of state, a relatively low-profile job in which Mr. Cuomo settled a rent strike at Co-op City in the Bronx and mediated a land dispute involving a Mohawk reservation.It was Mr. Carey who urged Mr. Cuomo to run for mayor of New York in 1977. Accepting the challenge with some trepidation, he found himself in a primary brawl with six brash New York politicians, among them Mr. Koch and Bella S. Abzug. In the first round Mr. Cuomo came within a percentage point of the winner, Mr. Koch, and the two headed into a runoff.It was a harsh campaign. In one instance placards appeared in middle-class neighborhoods proclaiming, “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo.” (Mr. Koch declined to answer questions about his sexual orientation.)Mr. Cuomo and his son Andrew, a campaign adviser, denied having anything to do with the placards, though Mr. Koch said he never fully believed it. At the same time, Mr. Koch was hammering Mr. Cuomo for his opposition to the death penalty. Mr. Cuomo replied that mayors had no vote on the issue and that in any case he supported a life sentence without parole for capital offenses. Mr. Koch won the runoff handily.Mr. Cuomo, on the Liberal Party line as well, was pressed to step aside in the general election. He refused, and lost to Mr. Koch for the third time. But he had learned a lesson. “I swore when it was over, to myself and everyone else, that I would never do that again,” he said. “I will never run a race that I don’t have my whole heart in.”Despite friction between Mr. Cuomo and Governor Carey, the two needed each other in 1978, when Lieutenant Governor Krupsak withdrew from the Carey re-election ticket and announced she would challenge the governor for the Democratic nomination, portraying him as incompetent. Mr. Carey asked Mr. Cuomo to be his running mate, and they won easily, in both the primary and the general election.Mr. Cuomo’s chance for the governor’s mansion came when Mr. Carey announced he would not seek a third term, in 1982. Declaring his candidacy, Mr. Cuomo once again found himself in a race with Mr. Koch. Though the mayor was the party favorite, Mr. Cuomo won enough votes at the Democratic convention in Syracuse to force a primary.Mr. Koch’s candidacy was undermined from the start by the publication of an interview in Playboy magazine in which he disparaged life upstate and in the suburbs as “sterile” and lamented the prospect of living in the “small town” of Albany.Mr. Cuomo proceeded to overwhelm Mr. Koch with muscular campaigning and a command of New York politics resulting in part from his years in Albany building a support network of state party leaders, local officials and union organizers.But he did not win over Mr. Carey, whose relationship with Mr. Cuomo remained strained. The governor endorsed Mr. Koch. But it did not matter in the end: Mr. Cuomo defeated Mr. Koch by almost 100,000 votes.ImageMr. Cuomo with Representative Edward I. Koch in 1977 before a debate between the mayoral hopefuls.Credit...William E. Sauro/The New York TimesIn the general election, amid a national recession, Mr. Cuomo tied his Republican opponent, the businessman Lewis E. Lehrman, to President Reagan’s economic policies and pounded him in debates, noting that Mr. Lehrman was rich enough to finance much of his campaign. At one point Mr. Cuomo theatrically fixed his gaze on Mr. Lehrman’s wristwatch and remarked, “That’s a very expensive watch, Lew.”On Nov. 2, 1982, at age 50, Mr. Cuomo became the 52nd man to be elected New York’s governor, defeating Mr. Lehrman by about 180,000 votes out of more than five million cast.Mr. Cuomo was sworn in on Jan. 1, 1983, before 2,600 people in the convention center of the Nelson A. Rockefeller-Empire State Plaza in Albany. (It was the first time since 1929 that the ceremonies were not held in the ornate but far smaller Assembly chamber.)His inaugural address struck a familiar theme, calling on state government to “be a positive source for good.” But for a national audience it also offered a critique of Reagan policies and a liberal vision for the country. Fiscal prudence, Mr. Cuomo asserted, did not prevent government from providing “shelter for the homeless, work for the idle, care for the elderly and infirm, and hope for the destitute.”With his mother seated onstage with him, Mr. Cuomo finished his speech by urging his audience to “pray that we all see New York for the family that it is.” Then he glanced up and invoked his father, who died in 1981 at 79, saying, “Pop, wherever you are — and I think I know — for all the ceremony and the big house and the pomp and circumstance, please don’t let me forget that.”From the start, Mr. Cuomo was a storm of energy and ideas. Within days, in the role of mediator again, he faced down a prison strike at Ossining — the old Sing Sing — in which 19 guards were held hostage. After 53 hours, the hostages were freed. He went on to veto the death penalty.But Mr. Cuomo could not satisfy everyone’s hopes. He responded to an inherited $1.8 billion deficit by proposing tax increases and deep cuts in the state payroll, stunning the labor unions that had supported him. Many other supporters grew disenchanted.He seemed inexhaustible, though. Reporters and legislators discovered that he was apt to pick up his own phone if they called his office on a Friday evening. “I’m sleeping less and less,” he said. “I work all the time. I’m not saying that’s a virtue.”He displayed a restless intellect and a love of learning. He liked to cite the French theologian and Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955), who wrote that endeavors should be based not on personal ambition, which can be a sin, but on a desire to contribute to the greater good of mankind and God.There were other clues to Mr. Cuomo’s manner. His precise parsing of an argument suggested indecision or even disingenuousness and sometimes brought him ridicule. Once, while fencing with reporters, he walked himself into the unlikely position of denying that the Mafia existed. “You’re telling me that the Mafia is an organization,” he said, “and I’m telling you that’s a lot of baloney.”In public he might respond to criticism with expressions of indignation and frustration; in private, with rage, often directed at legislators and reporters, often expressed in obscenity-laden early-morning telephone calls. The problem, he said in an interview at the time, was that people were not paying close enough attention to his words.ImageGovernor Cuomo nominating Bill Clinton for president at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York. Mr. Cuomo later withdrew his name from consideration for the Supreme Court.Credit...Andrea Mohin/The New York TimesTaking On ReaganBy 1984, a presidential election year, there was a different view of Mr. Cuomo outside New York. An eloquent spokesman for liberal politics, he stood out in a relatively barren field of Democrats with national stature. And behind the scenes, two close advisers, his son Andrew and Tim Russert, who went on to host “Meet the Press,” saw an opportunity. They successfully lobbied the party to invite Mr. Cuomo to deliver the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco.On the night of July 16, as the lights at the Moscone Center were dimmed — a bit of stage management orchestrated by the two advisers — Mr. Cuomo seized his moment, depicting President Reagan as having turned his back on struggling Americans.“A shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the White House and the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well,” Mr. Cuomo said. “But there’s another part to the shining city. In this part of the city there are more poor than ever, more families in trouble, more and more people who need help but can’t find it.”He became the story of the convention, overshadowing the nominee, Mr. Mondale, and an instant prospective candidate for president in 1988 should Mr. Mondale fail, as he was widely expected to do (and did).In the excitement of the evening, many Democrats failed to notice that the object of this attention had left for the airport, for a flight back to Albany. Mr. Cuomo liked to sleep in his own bed.That fall, with Mr. Mondale on his way to a crushing defeat, Mr. Cuomo volunteered that if he decided to seek the presidency in 1988, he would not seek a second term as governor in 1986. The declaration reflected how much interest there was in the governor at the time. It was also perceived as undercutting Mr. Mondale in the last weeks of his campaign, which many Democrats assumed was Mr. Cuomo’s intention.By then Mr. Cuomo, who kept a full-time pollster on his staff, had realized that every time there was speculation about his presidential ambitions, his popularity at home soared. Preparing for his own re-election campaign in 1986, he kept his hand in national politics, traveling across the nation and preparing for overseas travel.His re-election campaign should have been a triumph; instead it was by all appearances an unhappy passage. Until the final week he had declined to debate his overmatched Republican opponent, Andrew P. O’Rourke, the Westchester County executive, and had been irate at suggestions that such behavior was unsportsmanlike. He won a record 65 percent of the vote, but rather than celebrating, he retreated to his office in a quarrelsome mood. A few weeks later, he said to a reporter for The New York Times: “You set out to hurt me, and you succeeded. I hope you sleep well.” The next morning, he called the reporter back at home, offering an apology from “an old man with a bad back.”The election behind him, Mr. Cuomo announced a new schedule of national travel, encouraging renewed speculation about his interest in the White House. So it came as a surprise one evening in February 1987 when Mr. Cuomo, making his regular appearance on a radio call-in show, declared that he would not run.Power Declines at HomeMr. Cuomo turned his attention to Albany. He and the Legislature agreed to a new ethics code governing state and local government officials and state employees. He proclaimed 1988 the beginning of the decade of the child, 1989 the year to fight drug abuse and 1990, when he was up for re-election again, the year of the environment.But after Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee for president, defeated Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democrat, in 1988, speculation about Mr. Cuomo inevitably grew again.ImageMr. Cuomo, second from right, celebrated the re-election of his son Andrew to the governorship on Nov. 4.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesBut he was no longer the formidable figure in New York he had been. His popularity ratings had dropped. State legislators, who had never been fond of him, were emboldened to challenge him. He pinned the blame for this erosion of support on the way the news media had covered his response to all the talk about a presidential run.“You’ve done everything but call me a liar,” he told The Washington Post, speaking generally of the press. “You said that I was cute. You said that I misplayed the game. You said that I was really waiting for another scenario. Well, the net result of that is it costs me credibility, because you spent all those months saying I was conning people.”Recession, too, was looming and state revenues were declining. Still, in 1990, he won a third term. His Republican opponent, Pierre A. Rinfret, a financial consultant and economics adviser to presidents, had not been taken seriously even by his own party.It was a convincing but unsatisfying victory: Mr. Cuomo had done better against Mr. O’Rourke four years before.When he returned to Albany to deliver his ninth State of the State address, Mr. Cuomo suggested diminished ambitions for his next term. “This is a wonderful year for raw truth,” he said. “We don’t have any money.”But he had one more presidential flirtation left in him: in October 1991, while on a trip to Chicago, he said he was “looking at” a run. Many of his supporters had grown weary of such talk, some viewing it as a ruse to reinvigorate his sagging political image. And that December, with the planes waiting on the runway, he announced again that he would not be a candidate for president.It always bothered him, Mr. Cuomo said years later, that no one had taken him at his word. He would have run, he said in an interview for this obituary, had Republicans simply agreed to his request to pass a budget.“I somehow got this reputation of diddling and dithering,” Mr. Cuomo said. “I don’t remember dithering at all.”Stunned by PatakiMr. Cuomo’s remaining years in Albany were a series of grim footnotes as he struggled to keep the government afloat in worsening times. Mr. Clinton was on the verge of naming him to the Supreme Court when he asked that his name be withdrawn; Mr. Cuomo later said that he had never wanted the job.When the 1994 election season began, he seemed unaware of how much his popularity had eroded. He was stunned, he said, that someone like Mr. Pataki could pose a serious challenge to someone with his credentials. Mr. Pataki defeated him by five percentage points.Mr. Cuomo returned to Manhattan to work for the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, write books and give speeches. He grew wealthy and, he said, happy. He was always attuned to how he was perceived by the public, and when invited to sum up his own life for this obituary, he characteristically turned to self-deprecating humor.“People asked me what I want as an epitaph,” Mr. Cuomo said. He then reprised a line he had used many years earlier traveling across upstate New York, a fresh public figure displaying astonishing talent and obvious potential.“He tried,” Mr. Cuomo said.",2015-01-02T01:12:36+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/mario-cuomo-new-york-governor-and-liberal-beacon-dies-at-82.html,4318,1
New York Times,"LAS CRUCES, N.M. — On a dusty lot in a rough stretch of this city, homeless people have pitched dozens of tents, some nearly empty and others so packed with possessions that their residents are practically entombed inside. There is no electricity, and the unrelenting winds batter the tents so badly that duct tape, used for repairs, is coveted like gold.In other places, makeshift shelters like this one have been discouraged, if not destroyed. In December, a large encampment in San Jose, Calif., known as the Jungle was cleared because of health and safety concerns. In Detroit, officials were keeping cautious watch on a camp that had recently sprung up near downtown.But the nearly 50 homeless people living in the tent city here are welcome to stay. Local officials allowed the camp to be set up on city-owned property, making an exception to zoning rules that ban sleeping overnight. With a $45,000 earmark from the State Legislature, the camp is adding landscaping and a new fence. City officials say the camp has been a transformative force, bringing the homeless closer to social services and the prospect of permanent homes, while helping to clean up an area that had been plagued by drugs and violence.“We were able to look beyond what the codes and ordinances say to see what needs to happen here,” said Gill Sorg, a city councilor.The camp started as a temporary shelter in 2011, meant to last through the winter. It now has elevated plots for 50 tents and a guard house, surrounded by a wire fence. Called Camp Hope, the tent city has a few portable toilets — not nearly enough, residents say — but restrooms and showers are just a stroll away, to where several charities have set up a strip mall of social services, including a medical clinic and soup kitchen. There, social workers try to connect camp residents with government aid and low-income housing programs.Nicole Martinez, the executive director of the Mesilla Valley Community of Hope, a nonprofit that oversees the camp, said she had initially been critical of the effort. Her job was to put people into housing; instead, her organization was putting them in tents. “It just felt backward,” she said.She soon changed her mind.“I started to see it brought people to housing,” Ms. Martinez said. “They started to trust us. They’re not just coming to take a shower or get their mail. They see us every day. That really established a rapport we didn’t have before.”On a recent morning, the camp was near capacity, with 47 campers (11 of them military veterans), four dogs and three cats, Ms. Martinez said, reading off a roster. The youngest person was 18, four credits shy of his high school diploma, and the oldest residents were in their 60s.A stay in a traditional homeless shelter sometimes comes with demands that people are unwilling to meet, like early curfews or required religious services. At Camp Hope, alcohol, guns and abusive language or behavior are not allowed, and residents must do six hours of service per week, usually guarding the camp or collecting donations.“It got better and better,” said Dother Sykes, who was one of the camp’s original residents. “My safety is your safety, and your safety is my safety, so we started looking after each other.”Stanley Smith, who is 59 and also known as Cowboy, was back for the fourth time and grateful for a break from life on the street. “I can sit back and think, ‘What am I going to do next?’ ” he said. “You don’t have to worry about someone coming up and stabbing you or robbing you.”Las Cruces, about 50 miles north of El Paso, is New Mexico’s second-largest city, with just over 101,000 residents, many of whom work for New Mexico State University or the nearby White Sands Missile Range. The homeless here, some of whom have drifted across the country, say they have been met with a level of generosity that they have not found elsewhere.“It was the first place I felt human, that I could move through homelessness,” said Matt Mercer, 41, who was one of the camp’s early residents and now works for Community of Hope. He lives in his own home in a trailer park a short walk away. “This is a very conscious, compassionate community.”A few years ago, the city’s patience had worn thin with the homeless people who had taken over the area surrounding the charities’ offices, in an industrial pocket in the south-central part of the city. The informal encampment had become dangerous and difficult to control.New businesses have moved in, and Nathan Small, the city councilor who represents the area, said that maintaining good relationships with them would be critical to the success of the program. “The biggest challenges are ahead of us,” he said.The problems that brought residents here have not disappeared. One resident tends to sneak away in the afternoon and stumble back drunk. Others have been expelled for smoking marijuana, and hypodermic needles have been found on tent platforms. Tammy Nettnay — who described herself as a recovering drug addict, a prostitute and a felon several times over — confessed at a weekly meeting of residents that she had gotten drunk twice at the camp. But, she said proudly, when someone gave her a parcel of methamphetamine, once her drug of choice, she threw it away.“It’s not that I want to be here, I need to be here,” said Ms. Nettnay, 48, who came from El Paso in November. (Mr. Sykes, an old friend, told her to come.) “I don’t have any hopes and dreams now. It’s just day by day. I need God to show me what to do.”At meetings held every Tuesday morning, a host of issues comes up: Friction between those who collect money from the government each month and those who do not. Gossip. Ms. Nettnay complained about the portable toilets, which could use a scrub.After being homeless for 27 of his 70 years, Mr. Sykes has a place of his own, as well as a job harvesting pecans. The change, however, has brought a problem he did not expect. “The worst enemy, I found out, was dealing with the isolation,” he said. “Your mind gets wandering to old things.”To keep that from happening, he visits Camp Hope often, helping friends and ferrying them to doctor appointments or to pick up cigarettes. When Mr. Sykes arrived here a few years ago, he carried only a backpack. During a recent visit, he pointed to a gleaming cream-colored sedan in the parking lot. “Now, I’m riding in a Buick!” he said, bursting into a cackle, as if he could not quite believe how things had turned out.",2015-01-02T01:14:15+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/us/in-new-mexico-tent-city-a-glimmer-of-hope.html,1135,12
New York Times,"The police chief of an Atlanta suburb shot his wife early on New Year’s Day, telling 911 operators that it was an accident, officials said. The victim, Margaret McCollom, 58, was in critical condition, and the chief, William E. McCollom, was placed on administrative leave.Chief McCollom of Peachtree City called 911 shortly after 4 a.m. to report the shooting, Lt. Mark Brown of the Peachtree City Police Department said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. Margaret McCollom was airlifted to the Atlanta Medical Center. No arrests have been made.Because of Chief McCollom’s rank, the shooting was referred to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. A spokeswoman for the bureau declined to disclose details such as the nature of Ms. McCollom’s injuries, but said that the shooting occurred in the bedroom of the couple’s home. The spokeswoman, Sherry Lang, said the chief had been interviewed and was “fully cooperating.” Ms. McCollom, a nurse, had yet to be interviewed.“The initial reports that we got from the 911 call were that the chief had shot his wife accidentally twice,” Ms. Lang said. “As a result of our preliminary interview we have found that he shot her only one time.”Ms. Lang did not immediately respond to an email asking whether drugs or alcohol were involved.Lieutenant Brown said the police had not responded to any prior calls to the chief’s residence and that he did not know of any previous shootings involving the chief. Public records show that Chief McCollom was licensed as a firearms instructor in Florida.Chief McCollom is a Wyoming native who spent much of his long law enforcement career in Florida beach communities, serving for more than two decades in the Delray Beach Police Department before becoming chief of the Tequesta Police Department in 2006. At the time, news reports described him as a father of six who was married to Suzanne Carter, a rabbi who served as chief chaplain at the Delray Beach Police Department. They divorced in early 2014. An earlier marriage, to Margaret Alice Morse, ended in divorce in 1999. It is not clear whether she is the woman who was shot. Another news article said that he resigned from the Tequesta Police Department in 2010 to return to Wyoming to care for an ailing sister.In 2012, he joined the Peachtree City Police Department in a newly created position, assistant chief to Chief H. C. Clark, who had also worked in a Palm Beach County police department. Chief Clark resigned in July. Peachtree City is an upper-middle-class bedroom community south of Atlanta.

New York Times,"JERUSALEM — The political fallout from the Palestinian move Wednesday to join the International Criminal Court is likely to be swift and profound.Israel is expected to withhold tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority, restrict officials’ travel and possibly advance settlement activity in sensitive spots in the West Bank. The United States Congress may cut off $400 million in aid to the Palestinians. The already dim prospects for renewing peace talks now seem null.But legal repercussions from last summer’s war between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, or Israel’s settlements, would take longer and face many hurdles.The cases Palestinians plan to bring against Israel, and potential counterclaims against Palestinian officials, are unlike any the International Criminal Court has tackled in its dozen-year history. The Hague court, facing new scrutiny after the collapse last month of its case against the president of Kenya, may be wary of wading into the fraught politics of the Middle East, though doing so could help it rebuff longstanding criticism of its emphasis on pursuing African despots.“It may jump at the chance because it’s under fire,” Geoffrey Robertson, a British lawyer and author, said of the court, which he follows closely. “This is an opportunity to get out of the endless African wars and to do something which is very much in the public eye, and very much of public importance,” he added. “It would be a new and possibly productive way to deal with the cloudy legalities.”But other legal scholars said the United Nations’ estimate that about 1,500 civilians were killed in Gaza might not meet the court’s threshold for “unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity.”Michael P. Scharf, the dean of the Case Western Reserve University law school in Ohio, said that past cases “involved hundreds of thousands or at least tens of thousands of deaths,” and that the court “requires that they be committed as part of a policy or plan, and not simply incidental to attacks on enemy targets.” As for the settlements, Robbie Sabel, an international law professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said delving into them would put the court in the awkward position of essentially defining the borders of a Palestinian state.“Up to now the crimes they have dealt with are mass murders and rapes, not where a border is, an issue which is clearly political,” said Mr. Sabel, a former legal adviser to Israel’s Foreign Ministry. “My assumption is that on the political issue of where the border should be, whether East Jerusalem should be part of the Palestinian state, they would hesitate.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a statement Thursday that he expected the court to reject the Palestinian Authority’s “hypocrite application at once,” but experts on international law said the court has indicated that it would not reject the application. Israel, like the United States, is not a member of the International Criminal Court, but Dore Gold, an adviser to Mr. Netanyahu, said Thursday, “the arena is not just The Hague.”“If they want to open up the legal arena, Israel has many tools,” Mr. Gold said on Israeli radio. Citing cases in which victims’ families have sued Iran in American courts for sponsoring terrorism, he added, “if there is property belonging to the Palestinian Authority in the United States and the Palestinian Authority is involved in terror attacks against Israeli citizens, we can help them with claims all over the world.”The papers the Palestinians signed Wednesday acceding to the Rome Statute, which established the court in 2002, will soon be delivered to the United Nations secretary general and distributed to the court’s 122 member countries. There is then a 60-day waiting period before any member state can ask the court’s prosecutor to look at the Palestinian situation, or she could decide to do so on her own. A self-defined “court of last resort,” it would have to determine that Israel’s justice system had not genuinely addressed accusations of war crimes.There are also technical questions regarding the contours of Palestinian territory, the definition of Palestinian citizenship and the timetable for potential cases. Even preliminary inquiries can last for years.Some experts say any incidents since the court was created are fair game, while others say the court can deal only with matters since the United Nations General Assembly upgraded Palestine’s status to nonmember observer in 2012, or perhaps only after the Palestinian Authority joins the court in March. Shawan Jabarin, director of the human rights group Al Haq, said the Palestinians would submit a request for retroactive jurisdiction to last June 13, to coincide with the period being considered by the United Nations Human Rights Council’s commission of inquiry.Mr. Jabarin said the commission, with which Israel has refused to cooperate, would provide an initial report in March that could serve as a road map for the Hague court. Separately, his group and others have been documenting allegations of Israeli war crimes in Gaza, and are working with the Palestinian Authority to prepare complaints about Israeli settlements.“The crime is not just the rape and the widespread killing or something like that, but also to transfer civilians and to confiscate land and to destroy property,” Mr. Jabarin said. “It’s a different way of rape, it’s a different way of killing, it’s a different way of destruction.”The court defines a war crime as “the transfer, directly or indirectly, by the occupying power, of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.” Nearly 700,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory Israel captured from Jordan in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967; experts said settlers were unlikely to face prosecution, but charges could be aimed at government officials who provided incentives to lure them.“Crimes of aggression” may be added to the court’s mandate in 2017, possibly including the annexation of lands — which Israel undertook in East Jerusalem as well as the Golan Heights — military occupation and the blockade of coasts, as many international critics refer to Israel’s restrictions on Gaza’s waterways.But the court has not yet dealt with such issues. Experts said thousands of complaints had been submitted — one in 2011 urging that the pope and three top Vatican officials be prosecuted for “abetting and covering up” the sexual assault of children by priests — but very few pursued. (The church abuse case was not.)In November, the court’s chief prosecutor declined to investigate the Israel Defense Force’s deadly storming of a flotilla of ships delivering aid to Gaza, saying the “small number of victims” was not sufficiently grave. Joining the court would also open Palestinians to prosecution. Shurat HaDin, an Israeli legal organization, pre-emptively sent complaints to The Hague against President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and Khaled Meshal, a leader of the militant Hamas faction, as well as one about Turkey’s occupation of Cyprus in 1974, hoping this would deter prosecution of Israelis.Mr. Scharf, of Case Western, said any action in The Hague was “likely to unfold over a period of several years,” if at all. Gaza “is not a case the I.C.C. prosecutor is eager to take on, given its immense geopolitical implications,” he said in an email, and although settlements “may be inconsistent with international law,” the court was “highly unlikely to consider them a crime against humanity or war crime.”After the criticism she faced over the Kenya case, he added, “I would think the I.C.C. prosecutor would be more cautious.”",2015-01-02T01:39:42+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/middleeast/court-membership-wouldnt-guarantee-palestinians-a-war-crimes-case.html,1254,6
New York Times,"MEXICO CITY — A performance artist advocating free speech in Cuba was arrested for the third time in two days on Thursday, her supporters said, along with several dissidents after they went to a jail demanding the release of government opponents rounded up in a crackdown this week.The artist, Tania Bruguera, who was born in Cuba and splits her time between there and New York, had made clear in statements after her initial detention this week that she was determined to see the release of everyone else who had been detained.It was Cuba’s biggest move against the opposition in the two weeks since the United States and Cuba announced they would renew diplomatic relations.Human rights monitors said that up to 50 government opponents were arrested around the time that Ms. Bruguera was detained Tuesday before she could carry out an open mike performance in Havana’s Revolution Square in which she planned to ask citizens to speak about their visions for the country.Most of the activists were eventually released. But the independent news site 14ymedio.com, whose editor was briefly detained, said about 15 dissidents remained in custody into Thursday, though some were released as the day wore on.Ms. Bruguera, after a second arrest and release on Wednesday, went to a municipal jail on Thursday along with several dissidents, pressing for the release of the other detainees. It was unclear why she and the others were taken into custody, and the government made no statement.Ms. Bruguera had said her performance would test the climate for change in Cuba under the diplomatic thaw with the United States, which announced softened restrictions on trade and travel but promised to keep pressure on Cuba to improve human rights. The State Department condemned the arrests of several dissidents on Tuesday but has not commented on Ms. Bruguera.The Cuban authorities called her plan a political provocation. Although it denied her a permit for her performance, it had sought to negotiate for an alternative site, but Ms. Bruguera said the sides could not agree.Ted Henken, a professor at Baruch College who has written on social movements in Cuba, said Ms. Bruguera had not been known as a major dissident figure, but her art often reflected perceived political injustices in Cuba and elsewhere. The daughter of a Cuban diplomat, she has explored in her work what she considers the promise and the failings of the revolution.“It’s a good thing,” Mr. Henken said, “that the welcome news two weeks ago of the diplomatic breakthrough between the U.S. and Cuban governments is accompanied now with a vivid reminder that the Cuban government still needs to open up to the Cuban people and begin dismantling the often overlooked internal embargo it holds on the exercise of fundamental freedoms of the Cuban people.” ",2015-01-02T01:52:29+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/americas/cuba-again-arrests-artist-seeking-dissidents-release.html,466,11

New York Times,"Emergency dispatchers were jarred by a string of predawn calls on Tuesday: A man’s voice, the police said, asked that officers be sent to his location so he could shoot them when they arrived.“He called 911 and made threats to kill cops,” a police official said.A day later, at 8:30 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, investigators on the Upper West Side of Manhattan arrested Rayshawn J. Dixon, 27, and accused him of placing the calls from a cellphone between 4:30 and 5:30 a.m., officials said.He was charged with making terroristic threats and criminal contempt, the police said, and was awaiting arraignment on Thursday in Manhattan Criminal Court.The case brought to 21 the number of people arrested in connection with threats against the police since two New York City officers were fatally shot in their patrol car by a man who had made threats online and targeted the pair for their uniforms.The Police Department has now investigated in the past dozen days more than 90 threats it deemed serious among the hundreds that have streamed in from 311, 911, online postings and tips, including eight made on Wednesday through social media sites.The first step in analyzing them is to separate angry speech, hate speech and a threat “where someone is indicating they intend to act,” said John J. Miller, the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism.“What we’ve found in a number of these are, you’ve got dangerous people with serious criminal records, some of whom possessed weapons, who are making these threats,” he said. “And in other cases we’ve found guys who are big and bad over the computer but when the cops knock at their door, they are reduced to tears, saying they were drunk and never really meant anything by it.”The targets of the threats can range from officers in general to officers in New York City to specific people. They can originate outside the city or the state. The department’s Intelligence Bureau has helped in arrests in Yonkers and in Arlington, Tex., and has from Dec. 20 through Thursday made 29 referrals for officer safety to police agencies in other jurisdictions.Because the online postings are generally anonymous, investigators must figure out who is behind them, where they are and whether they had the intent or ability to carry out the threats, Mr. Miller said.Many of the threats echo those posted by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who killed the two officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, on Dec. 20 as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn.On that day, someone called 911 and said, “N.Y.P.D., I will blow you away.” On Dec. 31, someone posted to Twitter: “Let the piggies come. I got guns. Time to start shooting cops.”Such violent messages are further disconcerting to officers mourning the dead and taking steps to enhance their own safety, particularly in street enforcement. In Mr. Dixon’s case, it is believed that he called 911 at least twice, according to a law enforcement official, and said he was armed.He was arrested on Wednesday by several officers outside a pizzeria on Columbus Avenue and West 92nd Street, the official said.The police said Mr. Dixon, of 64 West 91st Street, had been arrested many times over roughly the last decade.",2015-01-02T02:13:17+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/man-is-accused-of-making-threatening-calls-to-police.html,549,19
New York Times,"BOSTON — The blood has long since been scrubbed from the finish line. The memorials have vanished, and the fund that raised money for victims has closed.But the ordeal is not over. Boston is preparing now for its legal reckoning with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who stands accused of bombing the 2013 marathon and turning Boston’s premier athletic event into a scene of terror and carnage. His trial will revive memories of how those bombs killed three people, blew the legs off 16 others and wounded 260 more.Unless some last-ditch maneuvering by the defense succeeds, jury selection is to begin Monday.Not since Sept. 11, 2001, has an act of terrorism wreaked such havoc on an American city. The devastation, both physical and psychic, was pervasive. In arguing that no jury here could be impartial, Judy Clarke, Mr. Tsarnaev’s lawyer, has said that virtually everyone in the region is, “in effect, an actual victim.”Ms. Clarke is famous for cutting deals that keep her clients off death row. At some point in the process, her clients — including Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber; Eric Rudolph, the Olympic Park bomber; and Jared L. Loughner, who killed six people in an assassination attempt on former Representative Gabrielle Giffords — pleaded guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison, with no chance of parole.But here she faces one of her toughest challenges yet: trying to spare the life of a reviled defendant in a case that traumatized and enraged the nation, while federal prosecutors appear determined to put Mr. Tsarnaev to death.“The nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who personally opposes the death penalty, said last year when he authorized prosecutors to seek it for Mr. Tsarnaev. And Carmen M. Ortiz, the United States attorney for Massachusetts, said in court papers that the death penalty was justified for Mr. Tsarnaev for several reasons, including that he used a weapon of mass destruction and has shown no remorse.As Mr. Tsarnaev sits in near solitary confinement at the prison hospital at Fort Devens, an Army base about 40 miles northwest of here, many say they dread seeing him in the limelight. But they want the trial to serve a purpose.“I hope the trial will bring a resolution for people who still feel unsettled,” Abby Miller, 22, a baker, said on Wednesday as she walked by the finish line on Boylston Street.ImageDzhokhar TsarnaevCredit...FBI, via Associated PressViews vary widely as to what that resolution should be.Kristine Biagiotti-Bridges, 47, of Mendon, Mass., who was pushing her daughter, Kayla Biagiotti, in a wheelchair across the finish line when the bombs exploded, says he deserves death. “Seeing everything going on in Boston with the trial and all the security around, the bomber going in there — it brings back that anger towards the stupidity of a few people that have ruined so many lives,” she said.Todd Koen, 42, of Beverly, Mass., a firefighter at the scene after the bombs went off, is just as infuriated at Mr. Tsarnaev but thinks he should be sent to prison for the rest of his life. “If he gets the death penalty he gets off easy,” Mr. Koen said. “He doesn’t have to deal with it or live with it.”Ms. Clarke, who is preparing a defense that casts her client as having been manipulated by his older brother, Tamerlan, has made overtures to prosecutors about a plea bargain, according to a lawyer close to the case. But so far she has been rebuffed, and her frustration showed in court papers that she filed Dec. 29 seeking to delay the trial.“If the government remains unwilling to relent in seeking death, and the case therefore must be tried, the defense is asking for nothing more than a trial that is fair,” she wrote. It will not be fair, she said, unless she has more time to prepare. In a flurry of last-minute pleadings, Ms. Clarke, who declined to be interviewed, also sought to have the trial moved out of Boston. But for now, it is scheduled to start here on Monday.Federal death penalty trials are rare. This would be the biggest since that of Zacarias Moussaoui, a Sept. 11 conspirator, in 2006, and the trial of Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, in 1997. That such a trial would take place here is the source of some angst. Massachusetts has no death penalty and sentiment in this city is strongly against it; a Boston Globe poll in September 2013 found 57 percent of Bostonians favored life without parole for Mr. Tsarnaev, while 33 percent favored death.Still there has been little outcry at Mr. Holder’s decision to authorize the death penalty. In July, a Globe poll of voters statewide found 62 percent supported it, while 29 percent were opposed. The state’s top politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, Gov. Deval Patrick, who is leaving office, and the Boston mayor, Martin J. Walsh, all Democrats, oppose the death penalty but none spoke out against the decision.Mr. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts stemming from the explosion of two bombs on April 15, 2013, near the finish line. On April 19, after a night of mayhem that included the killing of an M.I.T. police officer and a frenzied manhunt, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, lay dead, having been shot by the police and run over by Dzhokhar, who was escaping in a stolen sport utility vehicle; Dzhokhar was later captured in a boat in a suburban driveway.To many, the evidence against him appears overwhelming. Prosecutors have said that surveillance images show him at the marathon placing his backpack near 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed by the explosion. When he was hiding in the boat, they said, Mr. Tsarnaev, angry about the killing of Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan, scrawled incriminating messages (“Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop”), and while recovering in the hospital, they said, he admitted to the bombings.The court has summoned an initial pool of 1,200 potential jurors, all residents of eastern Massachusetts and far more than for any other trial here in memory. Only those willing to impose the death penalty can be chosen. The trial is expected to take three to five months.If there is no plea agreement, the trial will proceed in two phases, with the same jury. The first is to determine guilt or innocence; if Mr. Tsarnaev is found guilty, the second will determine whether he is sentenced to life or death.“The only interesting question in this trial is whether the most odious defendant who committed the most odious crime will get the death penalty,” said Michael Kendall, a former federal prosecutor in Boston. “Nothing else will be seriously in dispute.”It is during the sentencing phase that Ms. Clarke would make her case to spare Mr. Tsarnaev’s life. Typically, her strategy is to burrow deeply into her clients’ backgrounds, down to details like their prenatal medical history, to humanize them and help a jury understand what led them to such horrific acts.Ms. Clarke is expected to portray Mr. Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time and had no prior criminal record, as having been manipulated by his older brother, who will be cast as an aggressive bully and the mastermind behind the bombings.The case would then go to the jury for sentencing. Death sentences can be hard to obtain; federal juries have imposed them only one-third of the time, and the jury must be unanimous. And even though jurors must be open to imposing death, some find that they cannot actually do so.This is why jury selection is so critical in capital cases and can take weeks. Both sides are likely to employ jury consultants and run mock jury selections.“For the defense, they don’t have much of a case to put on, so their best hope is to get someone on that jury who will be a holdout,” said Jeremy M. Sternberg, a former Boston prosecutor with extensive jury trial experience. “They’re looking for people who are anti-authoritarian, who are not afraid to go against the grain.”Even if the jury imposes the death penalty, the appeals process can go on for years. Of the nearly 500 federal death penalty defendants since 1988, only three have been executed.Defense lawyers not affiliated with the case say that a plea deal for a life sentence could yield the same outcome as a trial, without the time and expense. Moreover, they say, it would spare everyone from reliving traumatic events, and the defendant could not appeal, meaning he would not keep cropping up in the news.“It makes all kinds of sense that they avoid a trial, and not just because of the very high probability that he will be found guilty,” said Eric M. Freedman, a death penalty specialist at Hofstra University Law School. “The families get to say their piece. And he does not get to become a martyr.”But Mr. Kendall, the former prosecutor, predicted the government would not agree to a plea.“Giving up the death penalty in this case would be a very charged political issue because of the horrific impact on the victims and the community,” he said. “There would be a lot of criticism. From a prosecutor’s perspective, the safer course is to seek the death penalty.”",2015-01-02T02:15:42+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/us/boston-is-eager-to-begin-marathon-bombing-trial-and-to-end-it.html,1573,12

New York Times,"ANTAKYA, Turkey — The cigarette smoke in the hotel room grew as thick as the cottony fog outside in this Turkish border town, as Syrian men, night after night, told their war stories. Their memories veered from exhilaration to black humor to terror, but mostly they told of what they had lost: Friends. A fiancée. An arm. A country. None were out of their mid-20s.Three were insurgents, or had been. One had helped capture an army tank; another had hidden in tall grass as tank fire killed his raiding party. They told of abandoning one insurgent group after another, finding commanders too violent, too corrupt, too disorganized, too pious, not pious enough.Three others, civilian antigovernment activists who broadcast war news on social media, were on the run from Islamic State extremists. For them, the fog was a comfort, shrouding their movements as they drove to the hotel. They had trekked for days from the remote Syrian provincial capital of Deir al-Zour, holding their breath at Islamic State checkpoints, hoping to find safety here in southern Turkey.But they still felt hunted, sure that the group had eyes and ears everywhere, among bearded strangers in Syrian-run cafes or in hotels welcoming foreign fighters. They did not tell friends where they were staying, and they did not know when or whether they could go home.Not long ago, these men would have felt secure here. Early in the Syrian conflict Antakya, long a sleepy provincial town, became the high-octane hub of an insurgency that thought it was winning. Back then, young fighters and activists, including some of those recently huddling in the hotel room, filled cafes to brainstorm, dreaming of new power and new freedoms.But some of those flocking to Antakya would later become their enemies. The city was becoming a way station for foreign jihadists, who spent lavishly, even spurring a market for Taliban-style dress. They ultimately transformed Syria’s battlefield, many of them coalescing into the radical Islamic State group, which routed or co-opted other insurgents and shifted the West’s focus from ousting President Bashar al-Assad to countering the extremist group’s momentum. Now, the group has turned violently against any Assad opponents who fail to flock to its banner — like the young men in the hotel room.Those men are part of what is looming as a lost generation of young Syrians. They are marooned in southern Turkey, unsure how to envision their future, and their hopes are deflating as rapidly as Antakya’s wartime boom.The small sample of men who filed through the hotel room to talk discreetly to reporters were from Syria’s north, east and south, some of them old friends, like the three from Deir al-Zour, others meeting for the first time. Yet all but one, a hard-line Islamist, had reached the point of wondering whether armed revolt — or even the civil protest movement that preceded it — had been a mistake.“I regret,” said one civilian from Deir al-Zour, a web designer and English literature graduate with a narrow, angular face and an intense gaze. “The best people in my country, they have been killed in this revolution. The worst people have controlled the country. And the goal of our revolution is not accomplished.”“My best friends are dead,” he went on. “We lost things.”His black ski jacket concealed the stump of his left arm. He was hit by shrapnel while filming a battle, and drove to four hospitals in the desert province before finding one with doctors and supplies; by then, his arm was unsalvageable. Later, when the Islamic State took over his town, he said, the extremists gave him a choice: Put his media skills to work for them, or die.“I cannot see my family,” he said, like most of the others, requesting anonymity for his safety. “Besides, our beautiful country was destroyed.”One of his friends, who gave only a first name, Hazem, said that some things he could never regret, like the thrill of his first protest, when his girlfriend whispered in his ear her excitement at defying the authorities. (She later married someone else because Hazem’s activities were too risky.)He long brushed away doubts, not wanting to betray his cause. But what brought him to regret, he said, was the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, because it divided the rebellion, pitting brother against brother in battling other insurgents.Listening from the scratchy carpet was Tarek Fares, who had played a more direct role, fighting on the front lines. But he flatly called the shift from protests to armed revolt a mistake. It allowed the government to cast itself as fighting terrorism, he said, and sowed divisions among insurgents over arms and money.The man who lost an arm shot back that, with security forces shooting protesters, “we could not have won peacefully either.”Iraqi Army Retakes Government Complex in Central RamadiEfforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.A first sergeant in Air Force intelligence from southern Syria, Mr. Fares defected in 2011 and fled to Turkey. He made his way back to the Damascus suburbs with arms for Ahfad al-Rasoul, part of the loose-knit, Western-allied Free Syrian Army. But that group accused him of treachery for coordinating with other insurgents, their putative allies.He and some friends switched to an Islamist group. But its leader, he said, was more interested in forcing them to pray than in fighting, and scolded them for dancing to “Gangnam Style” in their makeshift barracks.Mr. Fares started his own group. But because he and his fighters were not from the area, no one would sell them scarce food. He disbanded the group, he said, after he could scrounge only a few pounds of lentils to feed 50 fighters.Now he belongs to no group (he has worked occasionally as a guide for New York Times reporters), and misses the lights and nightclubs of Damascus.The lone true believer — the only one still taking part in battles — belonged to a hard-line Islamist (but anti-Islamic State) group, Ahrar al-Sham. While he condemned the Islamic State’s leadership, he said its fighters embodied true jihad.Given this landscape, the other men said, many anti-Assad Syrians are willing to hear out a proposed peace initiative from Moscow, even though it could leave Mr. Assad or much of his government in power.“A wide spectrum” would accept a deal if “he goes but his regime stays,” Hazem, from Deir al-Zour, said. “Syrians are bored of this humiliation and displacement.”Such views have surprised some officials in the exile opposition coalition, who have dismissed Moscow’s proposal.Hazem’s injured colleague said he expected little from Moscow or the world. Asked how the war would end, he said simply, “It will not end.”",2015-01-02T02:32:42+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/world/europe/vanguard-of-an-uprising-now-on-the-run-weighs-a-bleak-future-.html,1114,10
New York Times,"Medical experts seeking to stem the Ebola epidemic are sharply divided over whether most patients in West Africa should, or can, be given intravenous hydration, a therapy that is standard in developed countries. Some argue that more aggressive treatment with IV fluids is medically possible and a moral obligation. But others counsel caution, saying that pushing too hard would put overworked doctors and nurses in danger and that the treatment, if given carelessly, could even kill patients.The debate comes at a crucial time in the outbreak. New infections are flattening out in most places, better-equipped field hospitals are opening, and more trained professionals are arriving, opening up the possibility of saving many lives in Africa, rather than a few patients flown to intensive care units thousands of miles away.The World Health Organization sees intravenous rehydration, along with constant measuring of blood chemistry, as the main reason that almost all Ebola patients treated in American and European hospitals have survived, while about 70 percent of those treated in West Africa have died.Every hospital there should have “early, liberal use of intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement,” said Dr. Robert A. Fowler, a Canadian critical care specialist who leads a W.H.O. Ebola team. Anything less, he said, is “not medically justified and will result in continued high case-fatality rates.”Experts who favor aggressive rehydration point to several hospitals that claim unusually low death rates as evidence that it is effective. Skeptics say other factors may be at work.Even two of the most admired medical charities have squared off over the issue. Partners in Health, which has worked in Haiti and Rwanda but is just beginning to treat Ebola patients in West Africa, supports the aggressive treatment. Its officials say the more measured approach taken by Doctors Without Borders is overly cautious.“M.S.F. is not doing enough,” said Dr. Paul Farmer, one of the founders of Partners in Health, using the French initials for Doctors Without Borders, whose staff members have worked on the front lines of Ebola outbreaks for years. “What if the fatality rate isn’t the virulence of disease but the mediocrity of the medical delivery?”Doctors Without Borders representatives strongly disagreed, saying that Dr. Farmer’s assumptions about Ebola were incorrect, that intensive rehydration would probably not save as many patients as he believes, and that the W.H.O.'s position has not been proved.The group’s overwhelmed doctors do what they can, officials said, but it is hard to insert needles while wearing three pairs of gloves and foggy goggles. IVs must be monitored, drawing virus-laden blood for tests is dangerous, and patients yank needles out — sometimes in delirium, sometimes just to go to the toilet when no nurse is around.Ebola patients lose up to five quarts of fluid a day through diarrhea and vomiting. In that fluid are electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, sodium and calcium, and proteins like albumin. Electrolyte loss can stop the heart; protein loss can cause fatal internal swelling.Rehydrating patients and replacing those elements “is the antidote to the idea that everybody’s going to die,” Dr. Farmer said.Every Ebola hospital, he argued, should have a team that specializes in inserting IVs — or, better yet, peripherally inserted central catheters, or PICC lines. These are thin plastic tubes, inserted in the arm or chest and threaded through a vein, that can be left in place for days and the needle discarded.ImageA Doctors Without Borders treatment center in Kailahun, Sierra Leone. The group’s physicians have reservations about IV rehydration in the field.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesAlong with doctors at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who published an article on rehydration in The Lancet on Dec. 4, Dr. Farmer has also called for the use of thick needles driven into bone marrow with surgical “guns.” This procedure, known as intraosseous infusion, is slow, but it reinflates veins too shrunken to admit an intravenous line, and the needles are much harder for agitated patients to pull out.However, not all doctors know how to use PICC lines or bone needles, or how to inject fluids into empty abdominal spaces, another technique endorsed in the Lancet article. (The article was accompanied by a video in which Dr. Ian Roberts, the chief author, had some of those techniques demonstrated on himself. He used minimal anesthesia, he said, to imitate field conditions in West Africa.)Doctors Without Borders normally puts IV lines in as many Ebola patients as it can manage, said Dr. Armand Sprecher, an Ebola expert with the organization. That practice was temporarily stopped in September, when the disease was spreading so fast that doctors had only one minute per patient during the one hour they could work in their sweltering protective suits.The fatality rate across the group’s six Ebola treatment centers in West Africa was about 60 percent then, and is now 40 to 50 percent, Dr. Sprecher said. He disputed Dr. Farmer’s contention that rehydration could bring it down to 10 percent.“It would probably push it down some, but I’d be surprised if it were dramatic,” Dr. Sprecher said.Dr. Farmer cited the treatment given at a unit in Hastings, Sierra Leone, as an example of the kind of care he endorses.In a Dec. 24 letter to The New England Journal of Medicine, the Sierra Leonean doctors running that center with Western advisers said they had had a 48 percent fatality rate when they opened in September and had since reduced it to 24 percent.Each of the 581 patients the center has treated immediately received IV fluids with electrolytes, they wrote. Even without lab tests, each patient also received an antibiotic, an anti-parasitic drug, an antimalarial drug, an anti-vomiting drug, pain pills, vitamins, zinc and a nutrition supplement.“That’s effective case management,” Dr. Farmer said. “We’re cheering them on.”The fatality rate at the unit Partners in Health runs in Port Loko, Sierra Leone, is 35 to 40 percent, its director, Dr. Corrado Cancedda, estimated.Up to 80 percent of patients there receive IV rehydration, Dr. Cancedda said, and some have had bone needles inserted; no PICC lines have been used. Battery-powered electrolyte monitoring machines are being introduced.Dr. Sprecher said death rates at Doctors Without Borders’ six hospitals in the region varied, with the lowest being 36 percent in Bo, Sierra Leone.But he could not explain why. Some of the hospitals see more young adults, who tend to survive. At rural centers, the sickest patients die on the way there.Rehydration was only one lifesaving factor for the handful of patients transported to American or European hospitals, Dr. Sprecher argued, because all of them also received intensive nursing, and some received dialysis, ventilation and experimental therapies.He was reluctant to have his doctors seen using bone-needle guns on patients. “Not long ago, we were being accused of stealing organs,” he said. “You have to be sure people understand what the heck you’re doing.”A History of Ebola in 24 OutbreaksA review of the two dozen recorded Ebola outbreaks suggests some common themes.Dr. Sprecher also disputed Dr. Farmer’s comparison of Ebola to cholera, which both medical charities fight with aggressive rehydration. Ebola, he said, does more organ damage and makes blood vessels leak fluid.“In cholera, you can get fatalities down from 50 percent to 1 percent,” he said. “We’ve been putting people on IVs for Ebola for 14 years. If just tanking them up worked, we’d be doing it.”Lab testing is a crucial issue. For example, while low potassium can kill, so can overdoses. Potassium is used in executions by lethal injection.West Africa has at least eight laboratories run by various American, Canadian and European government agencies, Dr. Sprecher said. Until recently, they tested only for Ebola and diseases that mimic it, like malaria or Lassa fever.Now, he said, about half can test for electrolytes.Because heat and humidity knock out the machines that analyze blood chemistry, labs must be air-conditioned, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The C.D.C. runs two large laboratories in the region, only one of which now tests for electrolytes.Sometimes, conservative guesswork is called for, Dr. Frieden said. His father, a physician, gave potassium to patients who needed IV rehydration long before such tests were routine.The best-equipped treatment center in West Africa is the 25-bed United States Public Health Service hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, which is reserved for doctors, nurses, burial teams and others fighting the epidemic. It is fully air-conditioned and has 32 medical personnel, who wear high-tech protective gear that sucks in fresh air. Its on-site lab tests blood for electrolytes and proteins. The pharmacy has drugs to raise blood pressure or increase coagulation, and patients can be fed through tubes.Since it opened in November, it has had 14 Ebola patients. Seven recovered, five died, one was transferred and one is in treatment, a spokeswoman said. (Ten other people who were admitted did not have Ebola.) That is a 42 percent fatality rate, though based on a small sample, for the 12 patients whose fates are clear.Other units tread a middle ground, relying on what measures they have at hand. The fatality rate at the International Medical Corps hospital in Bong County, Liberia, is about 55 percent, said Dr. Pranav Shetty, the agency’s international emergency health coordinator.All patients who need IV lines get them, Dr. Shetty said. But when there are too few nurses around, usually at night, the IVs are unhooked, so patients may get only one quart of fluids a day. And only patients still urinating, indicating that their kidneys are working, receive electrolytes.Spending money on air-conditioning “doesn’t even cross our minds,” Dr. Shetty said, because other needs are more urgent.When IV lines are impractical, the W.H.O. urges doctors to make patients drink six quarts of rehydration solution a day.Nigeria’s victory over its Ebola outbreak in September was attributed in part to that. Dr. Adaora Igonoh, a 28-year-old Nigerian physician who survived the disease, became a symbol for the cause: The W.H.O. distributed pictures of her giving a thumbs-up while drinking the solution, and Bill Gates blogged about her story, telling how she forced herself to drink despite the repulsive salty taste and her vomiting.Still, even oral rehydration is hard, doctors say. Patients need anti-nausea drugs and must be pressured to drink. The solution tastes better when refrigerated. But, like air-conditioning, that requires electricity.",2015-01-02T02:36:35+0000,Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/health/ebola-doctors-are-divided-on-iv-therapy-in-africa.html,1706,1
New York Times,"There was little doubt that she would win her battle with breast cancer, Nora Zenteno said, because she was filled with faith that God would heal her.“I never cried,” Ms. Zenteno, 76, said. “I never think: ‘I’m going to pass away.’”Her diagnosis came in 2010. After a mastectomy and other treatments, Ms. Zenteno’s cancer is now in remission.Soon after treatment began, Ms. Zenteno’s daughter, Rosemary Bruno, learned that the constant fatigue she felt and the hair loss that accompanied it were being caused by a cancer of her own: multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.“I wasn’t listening to what the doctors were saying,” Ms. Bruno, 40, said while recalling being informed of the diagnosis. “I was more in shock.”The news came during what was already a difficult time in her life. She and her husband were on the verge of divorce, in substantial debt and about to lose their house, in West Islip, N.Y. During the course of receiving treatment, Ms. Bruno grew so weak that she could not continue in her job as a teacher’s aide working with children with special needs.Amid the increasing hardships, Ms. Bruno found some reason for hope.“I’d been saying I wanted a change in my life,” she said. “Maybe this is what it takes for me to become the new person I want to be.”Ms. Zenteno and her husband, Julio, did not hesitate. They invited their daughter to live with them in their home in Astoria, Queens.Ms. Bruno’s two children moved in as well, though both have recently moved out. Her son is in the Air Force; her daughter attends college, with the help of scholarships, in Florida, where she lives with an aunt.The cancer treatments have been grueling, and carry both physiological and physical costs. Ms. Bruno said she became so physically diminished that she refused to look in a mirror, unless she was brushing her teeth. She also had kidney damage, and now requires dialysis treatment three times a week.The Neediest CasesThe New York Times Neediest Cases Fund provides direct assistance to struggling New Yorkers. Tap for information about how to donate.Through it all, Ms. Bruno said she had tried to emulate her mother’s courage.“She inspired me,” Ms. Bruno said. “She was like ‘God has me.’ God healed my mom from cancer. He could heal me, too.”To try to alleviate her daughter’s stress, Ms. Zenteno transferred Ms. Bruno’s unpaid credit card balance, which totaled several thousands of dollars, to her own account and dug into her savings to help pay it off. Ms. Zenteno’s own income is modest: She gets $801.10 each month from Social Security and has also received $370 a month in workers’ compensation since retiring from her job as a seamstress in 1998 after being injured at work. Her husband, a retired delicatessen worker, receives $736 a month from Social Security.Ever since they bought their home in 1980, the Zentenos have sought to offset their living expenses and debts — including their $1,557 monthly mortgage payment — by renting out the house’s top floor for $1,550.“We were always very tight,” Ms. Zenteno said of their finances.Things got even tighter last year after a rent dispute with a tenant. The Zentenos evicted him in July after taking him to Housing Court over unpaid rent.“I’ve never had anything like that,” Ms. Zenteno said, adding that for more than 30 years, renting out the top floor had otherwise been stress-free.Before departing, Ms. Zenteno said, the evicted tenant had accrued a substantial water bill, leaving her and her husband owing $1,097 to the New York City Water Board. They had to spend nearly $7,000 more to renovate the vacated unit, she said.For assistance, Ms. Zenteno turned to Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In September, the agency allotted $557.15 in Neediest Cases funds to cover part of the Zentenos’s unpaid water bill.Ms. Bruno’s health has vastly improved over the last year, but she is not yet in remission and still requires treatment.“I keep doing my own thing,” she said. “I drive, I walk. People don’t even know I’m sick.”The Zentenos have a new tenant and are doing their best to manage financially despite their depleted savings, in part by working with their mortgage lender to reduce their house payments. Ms. Zenteno said she was grateful that her family’s health had stabilized, even if their monetary struggles remained.“I try to help everybody,” Ms. Zenteno said. “But I can do nothing now.”",2015-01-02T03:25:55+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/mothers-courage-helps-daughter-change-course-amid-illness.html,752,19
New York Times,"Since a bizarre incident in which Rudolph W. Giuliani verbally abused a ferret enthusiast on the radio a decade and a half ago, New York City’s ferret owners have been dealing with two major problems.One: They are, technically, criminals.Two: Everyone thinks they are insane.“People see it as a dumb, silly issue: ‘Who cares, weasels?’ ” said Veronica F., whose two clandestine ferrets, Watson and Nacho, live with her in Queens. “There’s a notion that we all have some sort of mental problem.”Now, ferret owners have a chance to change the law — and maybe remedy their reputation as well.Last spring, perhaps trying to demonstrate the relative warmth and fuzziness of the current mayor, or perhaps simply pandering to the all-important small-mammal lobby, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration proposed removing ferrets from the city’s banned-pet list, a zoological rogues’ gallery that also includes rhinoceroses, bats and poisonous centipedes. (A public hearing on the proposal before the city’s Board of Health is scheduled for Jan. 21.)The possible policy shift sent a frisson of excitement through the city’s underground ferret community.“I think of New York City as enlightened and progressive, and to have a rule in place that is so backward — I don’t understand it,” said Ariel Jasper, a member of New York Ferrets, a pro-ferret lobbying group.Ferrets are legal in many places around the country, including the rest of New York State, she noted. But thanks to the ban, they remain hard to find and little understood in the city. (The health department says it has no idea how many there are.)Ferrets are feisty, frisky, furry carnivores who have a unique musky smell and a way of expressing their happiness by “dooking” — making little noises of joy. They are cousins of weasels, but not weasels per se, a misconception propagated by Mr. Giuliani in 1999 when, speaking to an aggrieved ferret fancier in a now-classic exchange on his radio program, he lost his temper, called the man “deranged” and exclaimed, among other things: “This excessive concern with little weasels is a sickness.”Any change in ferret policy is subject to the approval of the Board of Health, whose members were all appointed by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. While no one at the board’s most recent meeting, on Dec. 9, accused anyone else of being mentally ill, neither did members seem thrilled about the prospect of a city teeming with pet ferrets.“The issue of ferrets has come before the board several times during my tenure,” said one board member, Dr. Lynne D. Richardson, with some weariness. “I’m trying to understand why this is something we would support. What’s the upside?”Mario Merlino, an assistant health commissioner, responded that rabies vaccines for ferrets were now much more effective than they had been in the past, and also that, under the proposal, ferrets would be sterilized and thus unable to produce baby ferrets.But the board peppered him with anxious questions: Aren’t they prone to biting children? Isn’t there a risk they could squeeze into tiny crevices in people’s houses and sneak outside, forming feral ferret colonies in the streets?No, and no, Mr. Merlino responded. At least as far as he knew.He seemed underwhelmed by the proposal himself, repeatedly mentioning the lack of data on various issues and at one point saying that the health department was “recommending that we open it up for public comment” rather than “arguing for it so much.”ImageAn owner with his pet outside the Wagner Houses in East Harlem.Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York TimesThe temperature in the room seemed to lower by a couple of degrees when the ferret portion of the meeting concluded. Introducing the next item, on a less fraught topic, the city’s registrar, Steven P. Schwartz, said: “I will try to bring the conversation back down to earth.”Such levity is insulting to ferret owners, who take the issue very seriously indeed. In Forest Hills, Veronica F., 27, explained why Watson and Nacho were excellent pets, and nothing like the hypothetical ferrets described at the hearing. (An illustrator for a video-game company, she insisted that her last name not be used, for fear of having her ferrets confiscated by the authorities).Ferrets have the independence and walk-by-themselves tendencies of cats, but the playfulness of dogs, she said. They are very affectionate and like to snuggle. They weigh about two pounds and can fit easily into carrier bags. They sleep a lot, up to 18 hours a day, so they make perfect city pets: Owners can put them to bed in their cages and go to work without feeling guilty.As for the notion expressed at the Board of Health meeting that ferrets might slip out through fissures in the walls in order to band together into outdoor gangs: Absurd, Veronica said.“I was almost laughing out loud when they talked about the colonies,” she said. “Watson is the laziest, clumsiest ferret. He takes three steps and he just plops down. He crashes into walls. I can’t imagine this creature surviving two seconds on his own.”Nacho and Watson, who are house-trained (and also deaf, a common ferret malady), are indeed exceptionally cuddly, able to curl up small or stretch out long, like Slinkies.They are also eager to burrow into visitors’ handbags. “Ferrets like to collect things,” she said. “Nacho has this stockpile of toys that he keeps. Watson likes to take water bottles and hide them.”Dean S., a 52-year-old ferret owner in Brooklyn who also insisted that his last name not be used, said it was irksome and sad to have to keep his two ferrets a secret. Unable to take them on the street, he said, he clips on their leashes and walks them indoors.“I don’t want to advertise them, because of this stupid law that we have,” he said in a telephone interview. “You might meet up with the wrong person outside.”Ms. Jasper, of New York Ferrets, said the law had created many problems for sub rosa ferret owners. Some are afraid to take their animals to the veterinarian, lest the vet report them, and so must contend with sick or dying ferrets. Vets who do agree to treat them are often unschooled in ferrets’ particular medical needs, she said, adding that they tend to overcharge.She also said that the unflattering image of ferret owners — that they are a little bit nuts — was as much the fault of the angry ferret lobbyist who sparred with Mr. Giuliani on the radio all those years ago as it was of Mr. Giuliani himself. Rather than being loud and attention-seeking, she said, ferret owners should fight the ban with cold, hard facts.“The notion that they bite — that’s a really outdated view,” Ms. Jasper said. “You’re more likely to be bitten by a Yorkie than by a ferret.”She also pointed out that nothing particularly alarming had happened yet in any of the many places where ferrets were legal.“If there was a large outbreak of children being mauled by ferrets,” she added, “I think we’d hear about it.”",2015-01-02T03:29:25+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/ferret-fanciers-excited-at-chance-that-new-york-city-may-lift-ban.html,1178,14
New York Times,"On the public stage, Marvin Wexler is a hard-boiled commercial litigator, skilled at defending the unpopular: the actress Vanessa Redgrave, for instance, when she was cut from a role for supporting the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1980s; more recently a New York City hospital, against accusations that it pressed Huguette Clark, the copper heiress and a longtime patient, to donate lavishly from her fortune.But Mr. Wexler also cultivates another side of himself, a do-gooder who faithfully shows up once a month to read poetry to a room full of elderly and disabled residents at a suburban nursing home.The other day, Mr. Wexler, in casual khakis and a button-down shirt without a tie, peered through his horn-rimmed glasses, a Walter Mitty of the legal profession, trying to coax 15 women in wheelchairs and one lucky enough to navigate by walker, to feel young and carefree again.But as he declaimed “Light One Candle,” the Hanukkah song by Peter Yarrow, no one seemed to be relating to the folk singers of yore. A poem about sunset on a snowy road left the audience cold. By all appearances, Mr. Wexler bombed. If this had been a trial, he would be making plans for an appeal.But this was not how Mr. Wexler saw it. He was used to this. The first time he gave a reading, some residents snored audibly and others rudely interrupted him. The trick, he said, is to modulate his own outlook. “I had to get over certain expectations that I had,” he said. “It’s not an easy environment to become comfortable with, especially the more disabled.”When he started the readings four years ago, he was motivated by past experiences with his own aging parents. His mother died last year, at 94, afflicted with severe dementia. His father, who is 97, is in constant pain. When his mother fractured her pelvis and was put in a rehabilitation center, Mr. Wexler, 67, brought along poetry and song lyrics when he visited. Old chestnuts like “Side by Side” seemed to pierce his mother’s disorientation, and she could sometimes sing along.“It seemed that going over poetry with her and singing songs with her was a tremendous way to interact with her,” he recalled. “When we did that, she acted decades younger than she was otherwise.”Convinced that poetry could be therapeutic, he asked the Sarah Neuman Center, the Westchester County campus of a sprawling nonprofit, Jewish Home Lifecare, based near his home in New Rochelle, to let him give readings, and the administration agreed.This year, he felt confident enough about his experience to write about it in The Journal of Poetry Therapy, in an article titled “A Poetry Program for the Very Elderly — Narrative Perspective on One Therapeutic Model.” In it, he argues that without intending to do so, he has developed a curriculum for others to follow.He alternates high and low, the edifying and the sentimental, Emily Dickinson with Bob Dylan, and painstakingly crafts themes he thinks his audience will relate to: Besides holidays, he has done movies (“A kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh ...”), doctors and illness (“The Microscope,” by Maxine Kumin), and success and failure (Shelley’s “Ozymandias”), among other themes.As a verbal exercise, it seems far removed from his legal work, such as his representation of Beth Israel Medical Center in a dispute over Mrs. Clark’s estate. The hospital got to keep $1 million that she left it in her will, but the dispute continues over money and a painting that she donated before her death, under coercion, according to the public administrator; of her own free will, according to Mr. Wexler.But he argues that poetry is not antithetical to the law, despite the common perception that legal briefs are dull and impenetrable. “Statutes are all about language,” Mr. Wexler said. “Constitutions are language. Trying to persuade someone of something, in ancient Greek they would have called it rhetoric.”Mr. Wexler could have been reading a legal brief as he began his program of holiday poems at the nursing home this week. Despite his dramatic efforts, the women seemed to snooze their way through John Berryman’s “Eleven Addresses to the Lord,” the 19th-century lyric “Over the River and Through the Wood” and a few more.Then he put up a PowerPoint picture of the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, to introduce a poem by Langston Hughes, provoking one resident, a disabled former waitress, to emit a breathless, “Wow!”Mr. Wexler paused to savor the moment.The next photo, of a debonair man with a pencil-thin mustache, drew a cry of “Hughes!” from Adrienne Bonda, 82, a painter.Later, as Mr. Wexler showed another photo to introduce “Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,” Mary Victoria Lachaga, 94, widow of a merchant seaman, swooned and said, “Nat King Cole!”Mr. Wexler read the lyrics, then played the song, and Ms. Lachaga, wiry and chic in a gray silk blouse, sang and juked her way through the verses seated in her wheelchair.Mr. Wexler was on a roll.Afterward, the former waitress said the tree photo took her back to when she was in her 20s, going to Rockefeller Center for the lighting, hearing Peter, Paul and Mary sing and going out to dinner. Ms. Bonda said that listening to poetry reminded her of the expressionist paintings she used to make.Ms. Lachaga was wheeled away reciting Joyce Kilmer’s “The House With Nobody in It,” from memory.Mr. Wexler slowly packed up his papers as if leaving court, having scored a victory just big enough to bring him back for more.",2015-01-02T03:32:04+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/soothing-the-aged-with-verse-a-lawyer-takes-a-road-less-traveled.html,944,15
New York Times,"Following is a transcript of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s inaugural address on Thursday, as recorded by The New York Times.Thank you very much. First, to Lieutenant Governor Bob Duffy, who said it all. Bob and I have had a heck of a four years together. A lot of late nights, a lot of stress. A lot of bad days, a lot of good days. And in going through the situation that we went through, you really learn a lot about the other person. And a finer public servant, a finer man I have never worked with in my life than Bob Duffy. He epitomizes everything the administration is about. He is hard work. He’s integrity. He’s performance. And he’s in the business for all the right reasons. We’re really going to miss him. We love him. Let’s give him a big round of applause, Lieutenant Governor Bob Duffy.So we really did have big shoes to fill, literally and metaphorically, when we had to replace Bob Duffy. And we found a superstar, and you heard from her now. The more you see her, the more you’re going to love her. She is great. Former congresswoman from Buffalo, N.Y., and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul. Let’s give her a round of applause.I want to thank Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam, who is very impressive. Court of Appeals judge. I wonder who appointed her. Oh, I did. That’s right. Let’s give her a round of applause, Sheila Abdus-Salaam.My good friend for many years, Mayor Bill de Blasio. Thank you very much for being with us, Mayor.We have our friends from the congressional delegation. Senator Chuck Schumer, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, Congressman Pete King, Congressman Engel, I see. Congressman Gregory Meeks — that’s too good-looking to be Gregory Meeks. Is that Gregory? The congressional delegation is very important to the way we do business, for the state to do what it needs to do — Congresswoman Nita Lowey! — for the state to do what it needs to do as aggressively as we’ve been doing it. We really need the federal government to be part of it and to be working with us, and they have been there every step of the way. I call Senator Schumer sometimes; I ask him for some things and I can hear the shock on the other end of the phone. But he never says no, and he always goes to it, and they have delivered for us time and time again — whether it’s money for Hurricane Sandy, $60 billion, money for the Tappan Zee Bridge that Congresswoman Lowey got us. Time and time again, they’ve been there. We couldn’t do what we do without them. Let’s give them a round of applause. We thank them very much.And Speaker Silver and Senator Marty Golden who represent the Senate and the Assembly for us today, who are our partners every step of the way: Pleasure to be with you. Thank them.Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins: Pleasure to be with you, Andrea. Thank you for your leadership.County Executive Mangano, County Executive Bellone, and Linda Mangano, pleasure to be with you.You heard from Reverend Karim Camara, who gave us the opening prayer. He’s also a fantastic, fantastic assemblyman. Pleasure to be with you, Reverend Karim Camara.Rabbi Michael Miller, who did the opening. He also brought us to Israel right at the time of the intifada, when Israel was really going through a period of violence. We said that was the best time to go because we wanted to make a statement. Some people didn’t understand that logic immediately, but it was the best time to go in terms of a show of solidarity. And I knew Michael in New York and how great he was in New York. You see him in Israel, he’s even stronger. And I was so proud as the governor of New York to lead a delegation that went and visited Israel when Israel really needed friends, and New York was there for Israel, and we always will be. Thank you very much, Michael Miller.You’re going to hear from Reverend A. R. Bernard who’s been a great friend and is a great inspirational leader for thousands and thousands of New Yorkers — he is going to be doing the closing benediction. Thank you very much, Reverend A. R. Bernard.Bob Duffy used the word “team” when he talked about my family — he was right. You don’t become governor without a team. You can’t manage the state without a team. And my administration’s all about a quality team. I’m just the good looks of the operation, I want you to know, they really — yeah, then we’d be really in trouble. But it is about my team. Both my professional team and my family, that is a team. And you saw Sandy and Cara and Mariah who are here. I have brothers and sisters. Madeline’s here, Maria’s here, Margaret’s here, Aunt Nancy, Uncle Bob, Lisa, Larry Belinsky, Howard Maier, Uncle Brian and — uh, what’s your name? I see you on CNN every morning. You look just like me, just not as good looking — oh, Chris Cuomo is here! My little brother is here. So they are my family, and they’ve been great all through this.We’re missing one family member. My father’s not here with us today. We hoped that he was going to be able to come. He’s at home, and he’s not well enough to come. We spent last night with him. We changed the tradition a little bit. We weren’t in Albany last night. We stayed at my father’s house to ring in the New Year with him. I went through the speech with him. He said it was good — especially for a second-termer. See? My father’s a third-termer. But, he sends his regards to all of you. He couldn’t be here physically today, my father. But my father is in this room. He’s in the heart and mind of every person who’s here. He’s here, and he’s here, and his inspiration and his legacy and his experience is what has brought this state to this point. So let’s give him a round of applause.And I want to thank you all very much for taking the time to be here on a New Year. It’s fitting. When we begin a new year, it’s a natural point of reflection. We review the past, we plan for the future, we make great resolutions on how we’re going to do even better. I want you to know that my resolutions are still intact. It’s been 12 hours, which is a new record for me.Four years ago, when I took office, as you heard from Kathy and you heard from Bob, New York was a much, much different place. And we were facing daunting challenges. More people unemployed than at any time since the Great Depression, when we took over. Upstate New York was hemorrhaging young people. You’d go to the airports, and you’d see young people getting on planes because they believed there was no future left in upstate New York. The state government, that was supposed to help, was supposed to be solving problems, was all about gridlock and all about dysfunction. And there was a pervasive, foreboding sense that the best days of New York were behind it, and that it was getting worse. And you felt that sense growing. I said at my first inauguration that we can’t underestimate the severity of the times, that this was not a moment for more speeches. It was about action. It was about results, and it was not about rhetoric. And that is what we did. We made the government work. We restored the economy. We created 500,000 private-sector jobs. This state today has 7.6 million jobs, more jobs than have ever existed in the history of the State of New York. That’s what we have today.We turned a $10 billion deficit into a $5 billion surplus. We put cranes in the sky in places that thought they were extinct. We expanded affordable housing. We passed universal pre-K. We gave hard-working families a tax cut. We expanded health care to cover — 1.5 million more New Yorkers are covered now than there were before. We made New York fairer with marriage equality. We made New York safer by passing sensible gun control. We set a national standard and committed this state to be the first state in the nation to end the AIDS epidemic in the next decade, and we’re going to do it.We did this. And the emphasis is on the “we.” We are the upstate business people who chose to stay and continue to hope. We are the public employees — the teachers, the police, the firefighters who serve and protect. We are the members of the New York State Assembly. We are the members of the New York State Senate. We are the colleagues in the federal delegation. We are Republicans and Democrats who put New York first and political parties second, even in this age of hyperpartisanship, because we remembered what we were there to do — which was to serve the public and not serve our political interests. We are the New Yorkers who put aside our differences to find commonality to move this state forward.Now, even with all we have done, our task is far from complete. We have much more to do. We have to rebuild the upstate economy, all across upstate New York, by replicating the successful model that we’ve used in Buffalo. We must address chronic high poverty in this state in many of our urban areas, from the South Bronx to Rochester. We must demand that the value of an hour’s work — the minimum wage — is sufficient to mean that you don’t have to choose between paying the rent and putting food on the table. We still lock up too many young people in prisons, at too young an age, at too great a cost. And that has to stop.Women are still too often victims of violence and are still trapped under a glass ceiling and still need a full Women’s Equality Act to give them full equality in this society.We must maintain our fiscal discipline and continue to provide tax relief for struggling families and growing businesses.We must do more for ethics reform to build trust, which is the lifeblood of any government.Our education system, while better than it was, is far from what we need to lead the global economy. We have new and growing challenges we didn’t have before, such as climate change and extreme weather, which have brought New York tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms and floods. Seven feet of snow in Buffalo, more than ever before, that’s saying something. I wouldn’t be surprised to see locusts next, coming up Broadway. We have new challenges to our public health system, like the Ebola virus. We have new challenges to our public safety system, where 13 years after 9/11 terrorism has metastasized from Africa to Asia, from Hamas to ISIS.These are challenges, to be sure. But the past four years have renewed our confidence and have shown us what we can accomplish when we work together. Remember how far we’ve come. It’s time to be bold, my friends, because there is no small solution to big problems. We can do all this that I’ve mentioned, and we can do more. And we must.Because in many ways the most severe problems we face go beyond the borders of our state, and the challenges are profound. We’ve seen the national unrest and the national discord. The American promise itself is being questioned. The offer of fairness and opportunity that was the American compact is now in doubt.Americans are disheartened, disappointed by the economic climate, and rightly so. We are told the recession is over. We read reports that say the economic numbers are going up, up and up — but we work harder, and we earn less.Income inequality is at the highest point in over a century. While American capitalism never guaranteed success, it did guarantee opportunity. And too many Americans are questioning the long-held belief that their children’s future will be better than their own. For too many, the dream of economic mobility has been replaced with the nightmare of economic stagnation.For previous generations our education system offered hope. It was the escalator out of poverty. The public education system could take an Italian immigrant’s son from the back of a grocery store in South Jamaica to become the governor of the State of New York. It could take an African-American boy from the Bronx and see him become the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It could take a child of Bedford-Stuyvesant and make that person the C.E.O. of a Fortune 500 bank.But that was yesterday’s public education system. Today, we have two education systems, if we want to tell the truth: one for the rich, and one for the poor. And if you happen to be born in the wrong Zip code and go to a failing school, you will get left behind and never catch up. Public education that was the great equalizer in the society has become in some communities the great discriminator. Today’s high-tech advanced manufacturing economy, demanding lifelong learning, has squeezed the middle class, and people feel left out and left behind. And that’s not all.If the American dream of economic opportunity was a basic component in the compact defining America, than the second component was our justice system. And our justice system ensured the promise of fairness and security for all. Our national symbol of justice, Lady Justice, carries a sword, a set of scales, and she also wears a blindfold. Why? To signify objectivity. Objectivity that one’s wealth, one’s class, one’s race are irrelevant to the pursuit of justice.But today, sadly, too many people are questioning if the blindfold is still intact, or does the justice system now see black and white, or black and blue, or rich and poor? The world saw an African-American man in Staten Island die. And people are confused, disappointed and angry. Law-enforcement officials have been wrongfully targeted, and even assassinated. The situation has devolved into one which everyone is talking but no one is listening.It must stop, and it’s time for the truth.The truth is: The justice system does need review. The truth is: There are troubling questions that have been raised that must be answered. The truth is: Police officers do need more safety and need more protection. The truth is: Law enforcement needs to respect the community as much as the community needs to respect law enforcement. The truth is: It is our obligation as leaders to provide the reforms necessary to ensure safety. This is a New York City issue, it is a Buffalo issue, it is a Ferguson issue, a Los Angeles issue, but it is also our responsibility to solve it here, in the State of New York. And that is a challenge that we are up to.Yesterday a young gentleman congratulated me on my re-election, and he said, “You know, I wish you good luck, governor,” with a sort of sad face. And I said, “Why is that?” And he said, “Well, you’re going to govern in very troubled times.” He told the truth, and he was right. These are troubled times.When Americans questioning our economic system. When they’re questioning whether or not they have economic mobility. When they’re questioning whether or not their children are going to do better. When they’re questioning whether or not the public education system is working for them. When they’re questioning our justice system and whether or not our justice system is fair. They are questioning the essence of everything we believed in. Those are the primary democratic institutions of this country. That was the essential compact we made, and that’s what they’re questioning.And that is the challenge before us: to be fearless enough to admit the truth. To talk about these problems no matter how difficult, because you will never solve a problem you are unwilling to admit. And then we must act, and we must perform, and we must deliver results that answer these questions and right these wrongs and restore confidence in what America is all about and what New York is all about.We can do this. We can create economic opportunity for all. We can raise the minimum wage. We can create good jobs. We can get minority youth the training. We can use job-training credits. We can create the best education system in the world. We can beat the bureaucracy. We can get results. We can make the changes that we need to make. We can get the resources that we need. And we can restore confidence and trust in the justice system, both in perception and in reality.Now you can say: “Well, governor, those are big challenges. Those are big challenges, and I don’t know if we can do it.” Yes they are big challenges, and yes they will be hard to accomplish. But my friends, that is what New Yorkers do. And that is what we have always done. We have always taken on the big challenges — taken them on first, gotten them done, and then created an example for the rest of the nation.We started with the Erie Canal in 1812. Here in New York City you think New York City made New York City. No, the Erie Canal made New York City. Governor DeWitt Clinton had a dream. The question was who was going to open up access to the West. How could you get goods by water to the West? And Thomas Jefferson and Washington and Virginia were trying to dig a series of canals that would get you to the Mississippi and that would open the West. And that would have made Virginia the main port. And DeWitt Clinton said: “No, I have a great idea. We’ll use New York. And you can come up the Hudson River and you get to Albany and then you make a left and you go through the state and you come out in Buffalo, and once you’re in Buffalo, you are in the Great Lakes. And then you could go wherever you want to go.” They said: “Governor, one question, when you make the left at Buffalo — at Albany — how do you get to Buffalo?” He said, “No problem, we’ll dig a canal.” Dig a canal? Five hundred and twenty-four miles. Eighteen-twelve. Built that canal. No hydraulics. Men, women and mules, they dug that Erie Canal. It made New York what it was. They came through New York City to go up the Hudson River to get to the Erie Canal. When DeWitt Clinton started that project, they wanted to impeach him because they thought he lost his mind. Literally. They said it can’t be done. It’s too ambitious. They did it. They did it on time. They did it on budget. It worked. It made New York State what New York State is, and it accelerated the whole development of the United States. That’s who we are. That’s the stock we come from.When they were talking about a dream of women’s rights and women’s suffrage, where did they go? They went to New York. And Elizabeth Cady Stanton said, ‘Yes, we can do this,’ and it is the New York women who came together and organized and got women the right to vote. When they stood up and said in the ’60s, gays deserve equal rights, it was us, at Stonewall, who stood up and said, ‘That’s right, gay people deserve equal rights.’ New York was there first. When a big state had to pass marriage equality because we were discriminating against gay people, and not letting them marry was just another source of discrimination, and you needed a big state to stand up and pass it — and it was hard — it was New York that passed marriage equality. And it resonated all across the country.After Sandy Hook, when we saw the massacre and we saw the children killed and we said, ‘Enough is enough with this lunacy of guns,’ and you needed a state to pass sensible gun control, who did it? The State of New York did it. We did it first. That is who we are, and that’s where we come from.Frederick Douglass once said, “If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” We know that in New York. Nothing comes easy. None of the ones worth it come easy. If it comes easy, you didn’t need it in the first place. And this is a uniquely New York moment. Because when things are at their worst, New Yorkers are at their best. And to any of those who have a question about our capacity, just look at where we are today: the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. The high point of New York, on the same site as the low point of New York at 9/11. Why? Because that’s who we are. That’s what this site says, that’s what this building says: You knock us down, we get up twice as tall. You give us adversity, we turn it into opportunity. You try to divide us, and we come back more unified and tighter than ever before. And that’s what these challenges are asking us to do: to take that great diversity that is New York, and to find the commonality and to come together for the good of New York.And once again, the emphasis is on “we.” We, as my father said so well, we are the family of New York, he called it, a collection of the most daring, bold, accepting people from every country on the globe. Every color, every creed is here in New York. Gay and straight, upstate and downstate, working together to make our diversity a source of strength and not of weakness, and to find our commonality, all for the same mutual goal of making New York a better state.We will do this, and we will lead the nation by our example once again, because this is New York, and we are New Yorkers, and this is what we do.E. B. White said, New York is to the nation what the white church spire is to the village. The visible symbol of aspiration and faith. The white plumes saying the way is up. That is New York. The symbol forward. The symbol that shows us the direction that is up.Thank you, and God bless you.",2015-01-02T04:08:10+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/the-family-of-new-york-cuomos-inaugural-address.html,3812,17
New York Times,"VERBANIA, Italy — For the second time in three days, the Italian authorities found themselves racing on Friday to rescue hundreds of migrants from an aging freighter that traffickers had pointed toward Italy and then abandoned, leaving the ship to plow through wintry seas at top speed with no one at the helm, heading straight for the coastline.Rescuers were able to board the ship only after it ran out of fuel and stopped, and by afternoon it had been towed to a dock. But the episode was further confirmation that traffickers had hit on a new tactic to extract ever greater profits from human misery while eluding apprehension.The latest drama came as the Ezadeen, a 49-year-old livestock carrier sailing under the flag of Sierra Leone, headed for the coast of southeastern Italy, in the eastern Mediterranean, with an estimated 450 people on board. There were reports that after six days at sea, the migrants, including pregnant women and dozens of children, had exhausted the supplies of food, water and milk on board.“When we called the ship to ask about its status, a migrant woman responded, saying, ‘We are alone, and we have no one to help us,’ ” said Cmdr. Filippo Marini, an Italian Coast Guard spokesman. He said the ship, which departed from a Turkish port, had been left on autopilot. Paramedics reported that the migrants, most of whom were believed to be Syrian, were in good health, he added.Until recently, migrants coming to Italy by sea arrived primarily in smaller boats that sailed north from North Africa. The shift to steel-hulled cargo ships approaching from the east denotes a new strategy, an Italian naval official said, and traffickers are “secure in the knowledge that no one is going to allow a boat to crash on Italian or Greek shores.”In record numbers, fugitives from war zones, failed states or repressive regimes routinely pay up to $6,000 each for a chance to fulfill dreams of security and new lives in Europe, braving not only rough seas and capricious journeys but also a groundswell of hostility toward immigrants across the Continent.“The money involved is huge,” said William Spindler, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency.The first rescue vessel to come to the aid of the stricken Ezadeen was an Icelandic patrol boat sailing as part of a program coordinated by Frontex, the European border agency. But the seas were too rough for rescuers to cross from one vessel to the other, and an Italian helicopter was called in to airlift coast guard officials onto the boat.After several hours of effort, and after the 240-foot Ezadeen had run out of fuel, the Icelandic Coast Guard ship took it under tow, Commander Marini said.Some analysts said the change in the traffickers’ tactics had occurred since Italy phased out an ambitious and costly search-and-rescue operation called Mare Nostrum, which located and rescued dozens of boats used by migrants. That program has been replaced by a European Union mission, Triton, which involves 19 nations but has a more limited mandate and finances.After a meeting in New York among top officials dealing with migration and refugees, a spokesman for the United Nations called the abandonment of large cargo ships “an emerging appalling trend in the human trafficking of migrants.”“This is the latest cynical chapter in the ongoing tragedy of irregular migration at sea,” the spokesman said.In the past, traffickers in North Africa had typically loaded migrants onto smaller vessels that are relatively easy to operate, said Izabella Cooper, a spokeswoman for Frontex. “But a freighter needs specialized skills; it’s a far more dangerous situation,” she said. The Ezadeen was headed for Italy at full speed when it was detected Thursday night, she added.Carlotta Sami, a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, told Reuters that over the past two months, smugglers were increasingly using old cargo ships ready to be dismantled. “They usually don’t even have any electronic equipment on board,” she said. The smugglers are using bigger ships because the end of the Mare Nostrum program makes crossing in smaller boats much more risky, she added.Officials said the smugglers probably left the cargo ship by boat, though it was unclear if they took a lifeboat or were met at sea by an escape vessel.In a posting on Twitter on Friday, the Italian Coast Guard said the vessel was being towed toward the coastal town of Corigliano Calabro. Antonio Saccone, an analyst at Frontex, said the use of bigger ships “shows how powerful and sophisticated the smuggling networks have become.”By Italian accounts, each journey of a big steel-hulled vessel carrying hundreds of migrants could yield smugglers up to $1 million. “It’s a precious cargo, and even after factoring in costs, it’s clearly an effective system” for traffickers, said an Italian Navy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under institutional protocols.The latest rescue unfolded just days after the Italian authorities boarded a freighter, the Moldovan-registered Blue Sky M, carrying more than 700 people, many of them fleeing Syria’s civil war. That vessel was also abandoned by its crew after setting out from Turkey.But the two vessels rescued this week were only the latest among at least 15 others that have left the coast of Turkey since the end of September, said Adm. Giovanni Pettorino of the Italian Coast Guard. “We’re very concerned about the practice of abandoning the migrants at sea,” he said.Last month, the United Nations refugee agency said that more than 200,000 refugees and migrants had arrived in European countries in 2014, compared with 60,000 in 2013. A large majority of them — 160,000 — arrived in Italy by sea. Almost half the migrants were citizens of Syria and Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, quoted migrants rescued earlier this week aboard the Blue Sky M as saying that the ship had set sail from Turkey.Typically, migrants said they were put on small wooden boats and rowed to larger vessels at sea.“It’s worrisome, because this new route seems to have very well-organized traffickers,” Mr. Di Giacomo said. “And if they manage to make a lot of money, they’ll be able to buy other ships.“Mare Nostrum may have ended, but migrants keep coming,” Mr. Di Giacomo said. “The reason people come is because their countries are in crisis.”",2015-01-02T08:08:37+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/europe/italy-migrants-rescue.html,1074,8

New York Times,"Anita Chanko could not sleep. At 4 a.m., on an August night in 2012, she settled onto the couch in her Yorkville living room with her dog, Daisy, and her parrot, Elliott, and flipped on the DVR. On came the prior night’s episode of “NY Med,” the popular real-life medical series set at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, starring Dr. Mehmet Oz. Mrs. Chanko, 75, was a fan of the show and others like it.“It starts off, there’s a woman with stomach cancer and her family, and then there’s somebody with a problem with their baby, I think it was a heart,” she remembered. “And then I see the doctor that treated my husband.”Mark Chanko, her husband, died 16 months earlier, in April 2011, after being struck by a sanitation truck while crossing a street near his home. The doctors and nurses at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center tried in vain to save his life.On the TV screen, she saw a chief surgery resident, Sebastian Schubl, responding to an emergency in which a man is hit by a vehicle. “And then I see, even with the blurred picture, you could tell it was him,” she said. “You could hear his speech pattern. I hear my husband say, ‘Does my wife know I’m here?’ ”There was no doubt in her mind: The blurred-out man moaning in pain was her husband of almost 46 years, the Korean War veteran she met in a support group for parents without partners.“I hear them saying his blood pressure is falling. I hear them getting out the paddles and then I hear them saying, ‘O.K., are you ready to pronounce him?’ ”She clenched her fists so tightly that “the palms of my hands almost looked like stigmata” and her mouth got so dry that her tongue stuck to the roof “as if I had just eaten a whole jar of peanut butter.”ImageMark ChankoCredit...Chanko family“I saw my husband die before my eyes.”No one in the Chanko family had given “NY Med” permission to film Mr. Chanko’s treatment at the hospital or to broadcast the moments leading up to his death.Such moments — indeed, all of the intimate details of a person’s health — are supposed to be shared only with a patient and whomever they designate, under a federal law known as Hipaa.In the 18 years since the law was passed, doctors and hospitals have put in place an ever-expanding list of rules meant to protect patient privacy. Yet even in the face of this growing sensitivity, real-life shows like “NY Med” have proliferated, piggybacking off fictional counterparts like “E.R.,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “House.”Medical ethicists and groups like the American Medical Association worry that these shows exploit patients’ pain for public consumption, but their makers argue that they educate viewers and inspire people to choose careers in medicine.“We have heard many stories of people who were inspired to go to medical school, to become nurses or paramedics, or to head into particular specialties like trauma or transplant surgery after watching our show,” Terence Wrong, executive producer of “NY Med,” said in an email. (He declined to discuss Mr. Chanko’s case or to be interviewed for this article.)Hospitals like NewYork-Presbyterian, meanwhile, have seized upon such programs as a way to showcase themselves, vying to allow TV crews to film their staff and patients — even emergency-room patients sometimes in no condition to give permission. When the first season of “NY Med” was broadcast on ABC in 2012, the hospital’s vice president of public affairs at the time, Myrna Manners, told PR Week, “You can’t buy this kind of publicity, an eight-part series on a major broadcast network.” (A second season, also based at the hospital, ran over the summer and garnered more viewers than the first. ABC has not announced whether another season is planned.)For the Chankos, the episode of “NY Med” added a coda of anger to more than a year of grief. Their daughter, Pamela Chanko, 46, said seeing the specifics of her father’s injuries and his death on TV sent her spiraling back into clinical depression. “It just sent me straight back to square one,” she said.ImageABC’s “NY Med”Kenneth Chanko, 57, Mr. Chanko’s son, filed complaints with the hospital, the New York State Department of Health, ABC, a hospital accrediting group and the United StatesDepartment of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office.The show had caused him “great emotional distress and psychological harm,” he wrote in a complaint to the hospital. “I had to unnecessarily relive my father’s death at your hospital a second time, while knowing that the public at large was able to — and continues to be able to — watch my father’s passing, for the purposes of what can only be described as drive-by voyeuristic ‘entertainment.’ ”ABC quickly removed the segment involving Mr. Chanko from its website, DVDs and future viewings (although not from the promotional blurb for the episode, which still says, “Sebastian Schubl, a Dr. McDreamy-like young trauma surgeon, tries to save the day when a critically injured pedestrian struck by a vehicle is brought to the E.R.”). In 2013, the state cited the hospital for violating Mr. Chanko’s rights.That was not enough for the Chankos, who sued ABC, NewYork-Presbyterian and Dr. Schubl for damages. An appellate panel recently dismissed the case, but the family has asked for that decision to be reviewed. Dr. Schubl and the hospital declined to comment for this article, citing the continuing litigation. ABC referred a reporter to Mr. Wrong’s statement.In court filings, the hospital and ABC do not dispute that they did not have consent from Mr. Chanko or his family, but they say the patient is not identifiable to the public. The network has asserted that because “NY Med” is produced by its news division, it is protected by the First Amendment. Lawyers for NewYork-Presbyterian have argued that the state does not recognize a common law right to privacy and that any privacy right Mr. Chanko did have ended upon his death. They say that the Chankos themselves are responsible for their loss of privacy.“There would today still be no identification of the patient or his family but for the latter’s publication via this lawsuit,” a brief for the hospital says.The day Mr. Chanko was hit by a private garbage truck had been entirely forgettable, his wife said. “If I had a diary, I’d leave the page blank.”ImageEric, Anita, Barbara and Kenneth Chanko, from left, in front of the deli where Mark Chanko was going to buy milk before he was hit by a truck.Credit...Dina Litovsky for The New York TimesThey arrived home past 11 p.m. after spending a few days at their second home in Goshen, Conn., in Litchfield County. As they unloaded their luggage, Mr. Chanko looked in the refrigerator and noticed they were out of milk and bananas. He decided to run across York Avenue, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, to a deli.After Mr. Chanko had been gone a few minutes, the building doorman buzzed up and asked Mrs. Chanko to come downstairs. Not understanding the urgency, she said she would be down in a bit.The doorman buzzed again. Moments later, the doorbell rang. When she answered, a longtime neighbor grabbed her arm. “Anita, you have to come with me,” she recalled the neighbor as saying. “Mark needs you. He’s been hurt.”When she got downstairs and walked outside, Mrs. Chanko saw an ambulance and her 83-year-old husband on a gurney, his head bandaged. The neighbor drove her to NewYork-Presbyterian. There, she watched as the medical team hurriedly pushed the gurney carrying her husband near the emergency room.“I rushed up because I wanted to run alongside him and just hold his hand and reassure him and say, ‘You’ll be OK,’ ” she said. The doctor said no. “That would have been my last chance to even say something to him.”Mr. Chanko was initially alert and awake, and able to respond to questions, medical records show. But he was in bad shape: His pelvis had been broken in several places, as had his left femur. The skin was ripped off his right leg.Outside the operating room, doctors and nurses could not detect Mr. Chanko’s pulse and resuscitated him. In the operating room, he became more unstable, medical records show. Twice more they tried to bring him back. He was pronounced dead at 1:17 a.m.ImageDr. Sebastian Schubl, in the episode that showed him treating Mark.Dr. Schubl and a social worker walked into the conference room, where the family was waiting, and shut the door.“I did everything I possibly could,” Dr. Schubl told them. “Unfortunately, he did not survive. I am sorry.”The family did not know until the episode was broadcast that a camera was focusing on the closed door of the room where they had gathered and that audio of Dr. Schubl was being recorded.Afterward, on the episode, Dr. Schubl turned to the camera and said: “Rough day. Rough day.”“It was the last clip before the commercial,” Mrs. Chanko said, “or as I put it, ‘Watch this man die, now we’re going to sell you some detergent.’ ”According to PR Week, the public affairs staff at NewYork-Presbyterian contacted Mr. Wrong in 2008, eager to bring one of his shows to the hospital. Mr. Wrong had completed two shows based at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and was working on another in Boston. After three years of trying, production began in 2011 at two campuses of NewYork-Presbyterian: Weill Cornell on the Upper East Side and Columbia University Medical Center in Washington Heights (some filming also took place at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn). But two months into filming the first season, Mr. Wrong later told The Philadelphia Daily News, “Weill Cornell was just not delivering enough traumas.” To capture more drama and action for “NY Med,” he said he signed contracts with other emergency rooms and began keeping videographers in NewYork-Presbyterian’s emergency room at Weill Cornell 24 hours a day.Mr. Wrong ended up with thousands of hours of footage, and the luxury of cutting any example that was not perfect, he told Capital New York last year. “You can be shut out of a critical moment that the case lacks emotional resonance without,” he said. “I will give you one of those: the ‘goodbye’ moment, it is the moment where a family says goodbye to their loved one going into surgery. If you don’t capture that moment, because a nurse shut the door on your camera’s face, you kill that piece. “Some of the patients and families captured by Mr. Wrong’s cameras have no complaints. “I think they were honest in their portrayal of our family and the love that we had and the concerns that any average family would go through when faced with this type of surgery,” said Dara van Dijk, whose mother’s heart valve operation was featured on the same episode as Mr. Chanko’s death. Ms. van Dijk did have one quibble: She was shown falling off a chair while meeting Dr. Oz in the episode. “In a million years, I didn’t think that they would show that,” she said.ImageMark, left, and KennethCredit...Chanko FamilyTypically, hospitals have not received money in return for allowing medical reality shows to set up shop, and NewYork-Presbyterian is no exception, an ABC spokeswoman said in an email.The real payoff for participating hospitals is distinguishing themselves at a time when other forms of promotion are no longer as effective, said Jennifer Coleman, the senior vice president of marketing and public relations for Baylor Scott & White Health, a large hospital system in Texas. Baylor self-produced a reality series about its cancer center and paid to broadcast it on local television. “Advertising is just so saturated right now,” she said. “You put your thumb over anybody’s ad and it’s just the same. That’s what people are trying to break through.” By participating in a major network program, she added, “They get that endorsement.”Patients caught up in emergencies are especially vulnerable, posing special issues for reality shows. They may not be conscious or be able to speak for themselves; they may be quite literally exposed, as caregivers work to help them.The American College of Emergency Physicians opposes “the filming for public viewing of emergency department patients or staff members except when they can give full informed consent prior to their participation,” yet show after show returns to the emergency room, drawn by the life-or-death stakes.The New York Times Co. was sued for invasion of privacy in the early 2000s, by a group of patients in New Jersey who appeared in “Trauma: Life in the E.R.,” a series produced for Discovery’s Learning Channel. One appeals court ruled that the show qualified as news and deserved the same protections under the law. Many of the plaintiffs settled their cases individually, a lawyer for them said.Mr. Wrong of “NY Med” said by email that he had not been sued over his medical shows before: “We put enormous behind the scenes effort into training our team and working in the medical environment.”Mr. Chanko’s family had already settled a lawsuit against the private sanitation company whose truck backed over him by the time his widow saw the episode of “NY Med” featuring his case.ImageA cameraman recording a procedure in an operating room for the real-life medical show “NY Med.”Credit...Donna Svennevik/ABCA couple of hours after watching her husband die on TV, Mrs. Chanko called her daughter-in-law Barbara, a health care ethicist at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs in Manhattan. Barbara Chanko, 55, remembers standing up in her office and saying, “If this happened, it’s got to be stopped.” When she watched the episode, she was shocked. “We protect patient privacy in everything we do,” she said. “I feel very betrayed by that medical staff for what they did.”The Chankos’ son Eric Chanko, 53, a physician who works at a hospital in Ithaca, N.Y., said he, too, struggled to reconcile what he saw on the air with his own work. “They basically did everything that you’re taught in medical school not to do,” he said.In the aftermath of the broadcast, a lawyer for NewYork-Presbyterian tried to assure the family that no one could identify them from what was shown on TV. “Please be assured that your father’s and your family members’ images, likeness and other potentially identifying information were completely obscured in the episode,” the hospital’s associate general counsel, Caroline S. Fox, wrote in an emailed response to Kenneth Chanko’s complaint.Yet a few weeks later, Mrs. Chanko said she received a call from a woman who used to work as a pet sitter for her and her husband. “She said to me, ‘Do you watch “NY Med?” ' She said, ‘That was Mark, wasn’t it?’ She recognized him.”Officials with the state’s health department concluded that NewYork-Presbyterian had violated Mr. Chanko’s rights and, indeed, its own privacy policy. “The patient was unaware and uninformed that he was being filmed and viewed by a camera crew while receiving medical treatment thus his privacy in receiving medical treatment was not ensured,” inspectors wrote in a citation released under New York’s Freedom of Information Law.New York regulators did not impose any sanctions on the hospital.Federal health officials are still reviewing whether NewYork-Presbyterian was obliged to get permission from Mr. Chanko or his family before allowing a TV crew to film him.A State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan narrowed the Chankos’ lawsuit, but allowed some claims to proceed. In court filings, lawyers for the hospital and Dr. Schubl made the argument that the law prohibits medical professionals from sharing information about a patient only after he has been examined or treated. Because the “NY Med” film crew had shot video during Mr. Chanko’s treatment, they claimed, it was legal.In November, an appellate panel issued a unanimous order dismissing the case. The conduct “was not so extreme and outrageous” to justify a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the judges wrote. The doctor and hospital, the judges added, did not breach their duty to avoid disclosing personal information “since no such information” was disclosed.The family is working on an appeal. “If this ever got in front of a jury, I can’t imagine a jury not thinking a wrong was done to my father and to us,” Kenneth Chanko said. “Morally and ethically it’s not right, and I would also think that legally it can’t possibly be right.”Asked what she would do if the case fails, Mrs. Chanko said the family would not stop pushing for redress. “If there’s no applicable law, there most certainly should be,” she said. “I’m willing to just pursue it all the way. Why shouldn’t there be a law against this kind of thing?”",2015-01-02T13:00:31+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/dying-in-the-er-and-on-tv-without-his-familys-consent.html,2765,1
New York Times,"SURABAYA, Indonesia — An Indonesian official said four major pieces of the Airbus A320-200 jetliner that plunged into the Java Sea last Sunday had been found. The wreckage was located by sonar equipment, but divers had not yet been able to examine it because of high waves and perilous currents, according to the National Search and Rescue Agency.“The four objects are in the priority search area,” Henry Bambang Soelistyo, the head of the agency, told reporters in Jakarta on Saturday.On Friday, officials said that they had recovered 46 bodies and identified three by the end of the sixth day of search operations.An Indonesian official told a local television station that some of the bodies were still belted into their seats.ImageWorkers unloaded coffins Friday for the victims of AirAsia Flight 8501 in Pangkalan Bun, Indonesia, close to the site where wreckage from the airliner was discovered.Credit...Tatan Syuflana/Associated PressThe official, Marsma Supriyadi, director of operations for the search and rescue agency, said eight of the bodies that had been recovered were sent to Surabaya, the capital of East Java.“With luck we’ll find more because search operations are continuing,” he told reporters in Pangkalan Bun, close to the site where wreckage from the airliner was discovered Tuesday.AirAsia Flight 8501, en route to Singapore, crashed Sunday with 162 people aboard, about an hour after leaving Surabaya on what was supposed to be a flight of about 90 minutes. On Friday, Indonesia’s transportation ministry said that AirAsia had not been authorized to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route on Sundays and that the airline’s flights on that route had been suspended.Mr. Supriyadi, of the search and rescue agency, said three bodies had been positively identified after forensic examinations, including DNA and dental tests. The three were an AirAsia flight attendant and two passengers, he added.Indonesia’s health minister, Nila Moeloek, said Saturday that autopsies would be performed on some of the bodies brought to Surabaya, in the hope that the findings would shed light on what happened to the plane. She said that some of the victims’ families would not permit autopsies for religious or cultural reasons.Where AirAsia Flight 8501 Was Lost and Debris FoundMaps of the flight path, air traffic near the plane when it disappeared and where debris was found.In the waters off Pangkalan Bun, international experts with acoustic equipment joined teams searching for the missing plane on Friday, but continuing bad weather held back efforts to hunt for the plane’s flight data recorders.Two ships carrying hydrophones, or underwater listening devices, embarked from Pangkalan Bun.

New York Times,"NEW DELHI — The Indian police said on Friday that they were searching for two officers in the Budaun district of Uttar Pradesh after a 14-year-old girl from a local village accused them of raping her.The two officers, Veer Pal Singh Yadav and Avnish Yadav, who were in charge of patrolling the girl’s village and are not related, were suspended and are now missing, according to Santosh Kumar Singh, the police chief of Budaun.“I am on the move with a police team and raiding different places to arrest the named constables,” said Ram Lakhan Yadav, a police official in charge of the Musajhag police station in Budaun, where the rape was said to have taken place.In an interview with the Indian news channel Times Now, the girl’s mother, who under Indian law could not be identified, said that her daughter went to relieve herself in the fields outside their house on Wednesday night when she was seized by the two police officers, taken to a room in the local police station and raped. The girl’s family said she was brought home at midnight.VideoThe brutal rape of a young woman in New Delhi in December 2012 has led Indians to ask why women are so unsafe in public spaces.

Her mother called him and the head of the village, and the family took the girl to the district headquarters to report the case the next morning.“These two cops are the area constables,” said Sudhir Pathak, the head of the village. “They used to come to our village quite frequently. They would frequently sit in front of the girl’s house.”The girl was at home with her mother on Wednesday night, while her father was out of town for eye surgery, her uncle said.The district of Budaun came under intense national scrutiny in May after the bodies of two girls were found hanging from a mango tree. The family initially said the girls had been raped and murdered by a group of men abetted by local police officers, and the police said they had confirmed the rape. But in November, India’s top investigating agency announced after an inquiry that there had been no rape and that the girls had committed suicide.The case initially provoked a public outcry, and many criticized the state government for not going after the accused forcefully enough.The office of the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, confirmed on Twitter on Friday that the suspects in this week’s case had been suspended.

New York Times,"When a parochial fight over a school field projected Mario M. Cuomo beyond the obscurity of Queens into a national figure nearly 50 years ago, his home borough was already reverberating with the shocks of tectonic demographic change.Almost as vast as the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island combined, Queens was always disconnected from the rest of the city. Today, it is also a world apart from the largely Irish, Italian, Jewish, Greek and German place it was back then.Former Mayor Edward I. Koch called it “the borough of moderation.” In the 1960s and ’70s, when many people feared that any change would be for the worse, moderation often meant intransigence.That was especially true in the face of the phrase “changing neighborhood,” a euphemism for poor people infiltrating all-white enclaves, whether through a prospective high school in Corona or in a hulking public housing project proposed in Forest Hills.“Are they coming? ‘They’ being a great unknown group of people, but it wasn’t going to be Italian-Americans with their fig trees,” recalled Michael G. Dowd, who was the community planning board chairman in Corona then. “It was the absolute fear that their neighborhood, in Corona or Forest Hills, would be populated by poor people. You can look into any person’s mind as to what poor people meant.”ImageMr. Cuomo on Election Day in 1990, when he won a third term as governor.Credit...Vic DeLucia/The New York TimesMario Cuomo, an unassuming lawyer who had been spurned by Manhattan’s white-shoe firms, emerged as the Great Compromiser, the Henry Clay of Queens, after the columnist Jimmy Breslin lionized him as a local hero.In Corona, 69 homes were about to be bulldozed to build an athletic field adjacent to a proposed high school. All but 13 were spared, in a deal Mr. Cuomo negotiated with Mayor John V. Lindsay’s deputy, Richard Aurelio, in 1972.That same year, Mr. Cuomo, who died Thursday at 82, was enlisted by the mayor to mediate a virulent controversy over the Housing Authority’s plan to build three 24-story apartment towers for low-income residents of Forest Hills. He persuaded City Hall to shrink the plan by half, reserve 40 percent of the apartments for the elderly and make the project the first public housing co-op in the country.His canny quest for the middle ground, in saving the homes of the mostly Italian “Fighting 69” in Corona and salving the fears of Jews in Forest Hills whose liberalism was being tested by a threatened influx of low-income blacks, did not avert change. He tempered it, though.“He mediated the transition,” Mr. Dowd said.In the decades that followed, Queens became the most diverse county in the country. The number of non-Hispanic whites plunged to 26 percent from about 80 percent, and the share of foreign-born residents doubled to about half of the population.The borough remained a magnet for people with middle-class dreams. “When you step into Holliswood, you feel like you’re removed from the mayhem and madness of the city,” said Michael Cavounis, principal broker at MAC Realty, who bought Mr. Cuomo’s old three-bedroom colonial house on Rio Drive for $400,000 in 2000 and now estimates that it is worth $1.2 million.ImageIn 1977, Mr. Cuomo playing basketball in the backyard of his home in in Holliswood, Queens.Credit...Tyrone Dukes/The New York TimesPeople moved to Queens, especially from Brooklyn and parts of Manhattan, when they could finally afford to.When the historian William E. Leuchtenburg asked Mr. Cuomo why Queens was rarely regarded as “an American place,” he replied: “It is a transition place. That’s why. It has no permanence. So it doesn’t have a history because it doesn’t have continuity.”Queens was also a political artifice, created from distinct small towns and parishes without a polestar — there is no postal address called Queens — and unlike Staten Island, another forgotten borough, without a geographic identity. It is more Middle America than Gotham. As late as the 1960s, Newtown High School offered a course in farming.The Holliswood in which Mario Cuomo raised his family, and the Corona and Forest Hills where he emerged as a public figure, have evolved strikingly since then.“Queens today is celebrated for its incredible diversity,” his son Andrew, the incumbent governor, recalls in his memoir, “All Things Possible,” “but in 1972, when this fight was unfolding, there weren’t nearly as many people crossing the Fifty-Ninth Street Bridge from Manhattan to eat authentic Indian or Greek or Peruvian food.”“The country was churning with black power and white flight, and despite its liberal veneer, New York was a city full of ethnic tensions,” he continues. “It’s telling that ‘All in the Family,’ set in Queens, was the country’s number one television show for five years in a row.”ImageMr. Cuomo's former house in Holliswood.Credit...Ángel Franco/The New York TimesIf Queens residents relished their independence, they also resented their subordinate status as bridge-and-tunnel refugees from an “outer borough.” The Manhattan cocktail may have been invented in Queens, but those temporary Manhattan-bound signs on Queens Boulevard that proclaimed “To City” were exasperating.“In Queens we never thought of ourselves as coming from New York City,” Mario Cuomo once recalled. “Manhattan was New York.”Mario’s father, an Italian immigrant laborer who cleaned sewers in New Jersey, saved enough to open an all-night grocery in South Jamaica, Queens, a mixed neighborhood into which blacks were moving and where Mario and his three siblings were born.Mario Cuomo recalled it as “an Italian-black-German-Irish-Polish neighborhood, inhabited by the poor and the nearly poor who lived in close to miserable conditions but were free from real frustration, because they had never experienced much better.” The family moved to Holliswood in 1949.As a Queens native, Mr. Cuomo both embraced and resented the role of outsider. The feeling must have been mutual. No wonder no New York City mayor has come from Queens and only two governors, Mario and Andrew Cuomo, were born there.Mario would later describe himself as “closer to the peasant roots of the simple Sunday practitioners than the high intellectual traditions of Talmudic scholars and Episcopalian homilogists.”ImageMain Street in Flushing, Queens, in 2014.Credit...Ángel Franco/The New York TimesAfter losing his run for a fourth term as governor in 1994, Mr. Cuomo moved to Manhattan, to a seven-room co-op on Sutton Place South, which he financed with a down payment earned by doing commercials for Doritos and Mad magazine. He joined a law firm and began, as he put it, “representing wealthy people, trying to make them wealthier.”But a miniature stone castle built by Mario’s father, and transplanted from the Holliswood house’s yard, stood guard on the apartment’s balcony. From there, the former governor could gaze across the East River at Queens, the shoreline sprouting luxury apartment towers while the population, Mr. Aurelio, the former deputy mayor, said, had become “a global ethnic smorgasbord.”In 1969, Corona’s population was 6 percent Hispanic; today it is more than 60 percent. At Public School 19, at last count, seven of the 2,000 students were white, while 1,800 were Hispanic and 180 were Asian.Andrew Cuomo recalled that when his grandparents moved to Holliswood in 1949, most of their neighbors were white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. He remembered, “my grandmother cried each time she recalled how a well-dressed woman had stopped her on the sidewalk,” as the new Italian family was settling in, to tutor her in the etiquette of neatly placing the garbage at the curb.For new immigrants, the learning process goes on. At St. Leo’s Roman Catholic Church in Corona, where only one Sunday Mass is said in Italian but three are said in Spanish, the church bulletin tactfully reminds parishioners in English and Spanish: “Además sea cuidadoso con las bancas del templo. Tampoco hay necesidad de bajar fuerte los reclinatorios al momento de arrodillarse” — “Please be gentle with the furniture. There is no need to bang the kneelers down during Mass.”Queens’s complexion has changed. People have not.“Now, almost everyone is an outsider,” said Irene DeBenedittis, whose immigrant grandparents founded Leo’s Latticini, known as Mama’s, and who still lives above the store on 104th Street in Corona. “But, fortunately, they all like Italian food.”",2015-01-02T15:37:43+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/nyregion/mario-cuomo-rose-from-queens-the-outsiders-borough-.html,1312,15
New York Times,"WASHINGTON — With more than 120 years in the House and Senate among them, four lawmakers offered a bit of parting wisdom to Capitol Hill newcomers: Partisanship is easy, governing is hard.As the 114th Congress prepares to convene on Tuesday, some senior members who will not be returning reflected on what they saw as necessary to the success of both lawmakers and the institution.In interviews, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa; Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia; Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California; and Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, pointed out the problems of recent years — failures that contributed to a steep decline in productivity on Capitol Hill as the gulf between the parties widened.They all agreed that Congress could not function unless members of both parties were willing to find some common ground.“I’m an unabashed liberal,” Mr. Harkin said. “I’ve been a progressive all my life. That’s who I am. That’s my philosophy. But it doesn’t mean that I won’t make a deal.”ImageSenate staffers wrapped and remove chairs belonging to retiring and retired Senators, including this one, which belonged to Mr. Chambliss.Credit...Stephen Crowley/The New York TimesThe legislators, whose expertise ranged from health policy to appropriations to intelligence and national security, urged lawmakers to dig in for the long haul, to remember that members of Congress are supposed to fix problems, not cause them, and to be willing to do what is right despite the political risks.“In the long run, if you focus on what’s best for America, you are going to be all right,” said Mr. Kingston, a veteran of the Appropriations Committee who lost a primary runoff. “You are going to be re-elected.”Mr. Waxman, who proved both a highly skilled legislator and an expert in oversight of government laws and programs during his 40 years in the House, is an example of some traits valuable to legislators: tenacity and perseverance.It was eight years from his first hearing on a mysterious disease affecting gay men until the signing in 1990 of legislation to combat AIDS. His fight for legislation to beef up the Clean Air Act, which he called “the most successful environmental law we have on the books,” took even longer, nearly a decade.Longer still were the 15 years from his first hearing with tobacco company executives to the signing of a major tobacco control bill, giving the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products in 2009.“I always felt that you have to reach out to Republicans,” Mr. Waxman said. “When I was chairman of the health and environment subcommittee, I welcomed their comments. I wanted to hear what they had to say. Many times they would make criticisms or proposals that improved the legislation, and I welcomed that.”ImageSenator Tom Harkin of IowaCredit...Associated PressMr. Waxman collaborated with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, on a law that gave consumers access to inexpensive generic versions of brand-name drugs. The 1984 law “is a great example of two very different members of Congress working together to address a critical need,” Mr. Hatch said.“Every bill that I authored that became law had Republican support of one sort or another except for one,” Mr. Waxman said, “and that was the Affordable Care Act, where the Republicans just would not support anything because President Obama was for it.”Mr. Chambliss, who entered Congress in the House in 1995 as Republicans swept out the Democratic majority in 1994 elections after four decades, said lawmakers need to abandon extreme views when they arrive in Washington if they hope to be effective.“We were all ultra right-wingers, but we figured out right quick that when you are in the majority, you have to govern,” he said of the 1994 class of House Republicans. “If you are going to govern in this country you are not going to govern on the far right or the far left. You’ve got to figure out a way to somehow get pretty close to the middle, otherwise you are going to do what we did — that is shut the government down. And we paid a heavy price for it. And you saw that again just a year ago.“We need to find the best solution that is not a political solution and that requires hard and tough votes to be made,” Mr. Chambliss said. “And nobody around here has been willing to make hard and tough votes the last four years.”There are fewer departing lawmakers than in the two previous Congresses, but many of those leaving are seasoned legislators. Among those exiting are Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat and longest-serving House member in history, and Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who spent 36 years in the Senate before casting his final vote on Dec. 16.ImageRepresentative Henry A. Waxman of CaliforniaCredit...Gary Cameron/Reuters“Many foresee a continuation of polarization and partisanship in the Senate and say it is naïve to suggest that the next Congress might come together, break out of gridlock, and accomplish great things,” Mr. Levin said in his farewell speech. “But I know the Senate can do better because I have seen it happen with my own eyes.”If lawmakers are to break out of the partisan cycle, Mr. Kingston said, they need to avoid being inundated by their constituents in an increasingly digital world where members of Congress find themselves under immediate pressure as events unfold.“If new members allow their base to control their behavior up here they are going to be miserable,” said Mr. Kingston, who has seen the rising influence of Tea Party activists on Republican lawmakers. “While the voters might be yelling and screaming at you to do something, that’s not your job.“You have to look at all the information and then make the best determination as to what’s going to be best for America,” he said. “Sometimes you have to have disagreements with your own party along the way, and that is O.K.”A similar sentiment was expressed by Mr. Harkin, who was the principal sponsor of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and 18 years later was the chief sponsor of a law that expanded disability rights again by overturning several Supreme Court decisions.“Don’t worry about the headlines or popularity,” said Mr. Harkin, also the architect of more than a few farm bills. “Just dig in and start doing it.”",2015-01-02T16:26:38+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/us/politics/departing-lawmakers-lament-capitols-partisanship.html,1045,12
New York Times,"WASHINGTON — The gun control movement, blocked in Congress and facing mounting losses in federal elections, is tweaking its name, refining its goals and using the same-sex marriage movement as a model to take the fight to voters on the state level.After a victory in November on a Washington State ballot measure that will require broader background checks on gun buyers, groups that promote gun regulations have turned away from Washington and the political races that have been largely futile. Instead, they are turning their attention — and their growing wallets — to other states that allow ballot measures.An initiative seeking stricter background checks for certain buyers has qualified for the 2016 ballot in Nevada, where such a law was passed last year by the Legislature and then vetoed by the governor. Advocates of gun safety — the term many now use instead of “gun control” — are seeking lines on ballots in Arizona, Maine and Oregon as well.“I can’t recall ballot initiatives focused on gun policy,” said Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. “There wasn’t the money.” Colorado and Oregon approved ballot measures on background checks at gun shows after the Columbine school massacre in 1999, but the movement stalled after that.The National Rifle Association, which raises millions of dollars a year largely from small donors and has one of the most muscular state lobbying apparatuses in the country, is well attuned to its foes’ shift in focus. “We will be wherever they are to challenge them,” said Andrew Arulanandam, the group’s spokesman.The new focus on ballot initiatives comes after setbacks in Congress and in statehouses. After the 2012 mass shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., President Obama’s effort to pass a background-check measure never got out of the Democratic-controlled Senate. Although 10 states have passed major gun control legislation, not only in Connecticut and New York but also as far away as Colorado, more states have loosened gun restrictions.Candidates who backed gun control mostly lost in the midterm elections, even after groups spent millions on their behalf. The last setback came in December when Martha McSally, a Republican, prevailed in a razor-thin recount over Representative Ron Barber, Democrat of Arizona. Mr. Barber was wounded in the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords, and lost even though Ms. Giffords’s PAC, Americans for Responsible Solutions, spent more than $2 million in the race.ImageGov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia has proposed the restoration of the state’s limit on handgun sales to one a month.Credit...Molly Riley/Associated PressGun control groups say that although they are still dwarfed by the N.R.A., they have more money and are involved in more grass-roots activism than ever before. The N.R.A. was even heavily outspent in the Washington State referendum.The advocacy groups have recast their cause as a public health and safety movement, and are homing in on areas where polling has shown voter support, like expanded background checks and keeping guns out of the hands of people with domestic violence convictions, restraining orders or mental illnesses.Some of those provisions have gained steam even in heavily Republican-controlled state governments, like those in Louisiana and Wisconsin.“Things that people feel are most doable politically right now are connected to domestic violence,” Mr. Webster said. “There is a lot of uptick on that issue even in red states and states with a lot of guns.” In the past two years, 11 states have passed such legislation.Closing loopholes on background checks for gun owners is an area Americans support far more than steps like curbs on assault weapons or limits on magazine sizes. A recent Pew survey, for instance, showed that 52 percent of respondents said they believed it was more important to protect gun ownership rights. That figure was up from 29 percent in 2000. Still, in a 2013 poll, Pew found that nearly 75 percent of respondents supported background-check expansions.Gun control advocates believe that ensuring background checks for the majority of gun buyers is the foundation of all other existing laws. “The reason voters support these laws is the same reason the movement supports these laws,” said Laura Cutilletta, a senior lawyer for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The same-sex marriage movement has been a model for advocates of new gun restrictions. As with gay marriage, background-check expansions enjoy far broader public support in polls than among elected officials, and they affect state residents immediately.“The arc of the marriage-equality movement started in the federal government, and got them the Defense of Marriage Act,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group backed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. “Then they went to the states and showed that if you can get the majority of the public on your side state by state, that will influence the courts and Congress in the end.”Their efforts have emboldened some governors and lawmakers, largely, but not exclusively, in solidly blue states. What is more, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado — both Democrats who pushed through a series of tough gun laws in their states after the Newtown massacre — won re-election. Two Colorado Democrats who strongly supported that state’s gun control package were booted from office in a special election in 2013. But the Democratic Party regained the seats in November.Last month, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, which has been the source of many illegally obtained guns in other states, proposed the restoration of the state’s limit on handgun sales to one a month to slow the “iron highway,” a nickname for gunrunning up Interstate 95 to states to the north. He would also seek mandatory background checks on gun sales at firearm shows, and end issuing gun permits to anyone restrained under domestic violence orders of protection.ImageA firearms buyer looked at hand guns on display during the Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show in Las Vegas last January.Credit...Julie Jacobson/Associated Press“I own three guns,” said Mr. McAuliffe, a Democrat. “I love to take my three boys hunting. This is not gun restriction, this is anticrime. I couch it in economic terms.”The prospects for his gun proposals did not look great out of the gate. The governor “knows refighting the one-gun-a-month battle will not be productive,” Thomas K. Norment Jr., the Republican majority leader of the Virginia legislature, said in a statement.For gun control groups, money is not the problem it was only recently. Contested ballot-initiative programs cost somewhere between $5 million and $15 million, said Pia Carusone, a senior adviser to Ms. Giffords’s group.It has raised roughly $30 million for all political activities, including the Washington State initiative, over the past two years. And Mr. Bloomberg has spent millions of dollars on everything from research to political campaigns to the Washington referendum, and is prepared to continue to do so.Gun rights groups plan to meet them head-on. “The terrain gets a lot harder for him,” Mr. Arulanandam, the N.R.A. spokesman, said of Mr. Bloomberg.The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence — along with other advocacy groups — is evaluating which states among the 17 that allow ballot initiatives are the best spots to pick for the next fight; Maine, Arizona and Oregon, should their legislatures not take action, are widely viewed as the three with the most potential for gun control advocates.In Washington, those who pushed the ballot measure through say they will begin a campaign to get the State Legislature to pass measures to keep guns from those with mental illnesses, children and people with a record of domestic violence. Opponents of gun control, for their part, went to the courts this week to challenge the new background-check requirements.As with the same-sex marriage movement — as well as efforts by some conservative groups to  weaken unions and to make abortions more difficult to obtain — the efforts of both gun rights advocates and advocates for gun restrictions demonstrate a fading faith that legislative remedies are to be found in Congress.“Whether it’s on guns or immigration or tax reform, clearly Washington is broken,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “You have to influence the federal government at the state.”",2015-01-02T16:51:19+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/us/gun-control-groups-blocked-in-washington-turn-attention-to-states.html,1337,1
New York Times,"If the wind is right, the scent of chocolate will waft up 35th Street in Brooklyn from the waterfront toward the commercial strip of Sunset Park, winding past pornography shops, liquor wholesalers and building-supply warehouses. Once you pass under the Gowanus Expressway, there is no mistaking it, even amid the exhaust of the 18-wheelers jockeying for position on the cobblestone streets in front of the loading docks of Industry City.Industry City is a complex of 16 buildings on the edge of Sunset Park, wedged between Costco and the Metropolitan Detention Center. Formerly known as Bush Terminal, a wholesalers’ port throughout the 20th century, the facility is undergoing a $100 million update, moving from a somewhat derelict warren of artists’ studios to an upscale, artisan-friendly commercial space.Li-Lac Chocolates, with its purple banner and inviting aromas, became one of Industry City’s more high-profile tenants when it opened in October.Wraparound windows invite visitors to observe the chocolate-making process — copper kettles bubbling with sugar, the jiggling enrobing machine, a conveyor belt that shakes loose excess chocolate from candied orange slices. “Who doesn’t love chocolate?” said Anthony Luna, 17, a senior at Sunset Park High School who landed a seasonal packing job for $9 an hour during the holiday rush.But in fact, some people in Sunset Park were less than excited to welcome Li-Lac to the neighborhood. One of them was Elizabeth Yeampierre. As the executive director of Uprose, a historically Latino community organization, Ms. Yeampierre condemned Li-Lac’s grand opening on Facebook, describing the planned festivities as “a celebration of gentrification” and urging residents to boycott the shop. Though Ms. Yeampierre has since scaled back her criticism — she later said she was speaking for herself, not Uprose — her comments might have contributed to a call for a police presence at the opening event, which attracted more than 1,000 visitors.ImageThe offices of Uprose, whose leader urged a boycott of Li-Lac’s grand opening.Credit...Nicole Bengiveno/The New York TimesChris Taylor, 52, a co-owner of Li-Lac, said the potential for a boycott caught him off guard. “I got an email from someone in the community two days before the opening and thought it was a joke,” he recalled. “It took me a few days to realize it was serious.”Mr. Taylor expressed surprise that Li-Lac would be cast as a gentrifier. “Our founder was an immigrant from Greece,” he said. “Two of the three current co-owners are immigrants.” One of them, Anwar Khoder, 54, emigrated from Lebanon to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, nearly three decades ago and worked as a taxi driver before becoming Li-Lac’s master chocolatier.“We’re locals,” said another owner, Anthony Cirone, 49. “We’re not an unknown corporate entity owned by unnamed people in faraway places.”But the idea that a sudden influx of money might disrupt the character of a neighborhood should surprise no one. “The industrial waterfront has always been a walk-to-work community,” Ms. Yeampierre said. “It needs to be a place where blue-collar people can live and work. I was reacting to what I was seeing as a trend to hurt the composition of the neighborhood.” She expressed fear that high-end shops selling artisanal wares — places like Liddabit Sweets, Blue Marble Ice Cream and Colson Patisserie, which have all set up shop in Industry City — would transform the neighborhood into another Dumbo or Chelsea, mowing down smaller establishments.And yet Li-Lac is itself a victim of high rents and real-estate churn.Ten years ago, Li-Lac Chocolates moved from its original home at 120 Christopher Street in Manhattan, where it had been for 81 years, to a storefront on Jane Street. There was no room for manufacturing in the West Village, so the factory occupied a smaller industrial spot farther south in Sunset Park until Industry City became available. “We were ready to throw in the towel on New York, because making chocolate in Manhattan is no longer viable,” Mr. Taylor said. “Our store on Jane Street is surrounded by shops with purses and shoes without price tags, so that tells you something.”The 10,000-square-foot Industry City facility is 15 times larger than the West Village storefront — and the tiny Manhattan shop costs 18 times more per square foot, Mr. Taylor said. According to Mr. Taylor, many chocolate wholesalers are moving to Pennsylvania, where rents and taxes are lower. With Li-Lac being one of Manhattan’s oldest chocolate companies, “we wanted to be in New York,” he said.ImageLi-Lac’s old shop on Christopher Street in 1980.Credit...Keith Meyers/The New York TimesSome local business owners “uphill,” on the commercial stretches of Fourth and Fifth Avenues, report that Industry City has actually been a boon to their operations. Jose Luis Hernandez, 39, a co-owner of Café Zona Sur, a tin-ceilinged fusion bistro that offers free-range chicken and a risotto of the day, said he often received 30- or 40-person catering orders from the complex.Renée Giordano, 63, executive director of the Sunset Park Business Improvement District, noted that the products made at Industry City “aren’t heavy competition” for the existing businesses on Fifth Avenue. The bustling street is dotted with 24-hour check-cashing services, sneaker stores, no-frills laundromats, restaurants and barber shops that stay open for card games long after the floors have been swept clean.So far, Ms. Giordano said, she has not noticed people trickling uphill to patronize the shops on Fifth Avenue after visiting Industry City. “But as long as those businesses interact with and hire from the community, it can’t hurt,” she said.“Gentrification will probably come up at any community board meeting you’d ever attend in New York City,” said Daniel Murphy, 44, chairman of Brooklyn’s Community Board 7, which includes Sunset Park. “We see Industry City as a change. If you see every change as a threat, your amygdala is too active.” He pointed out that neighborhoods are constantly in flux. As he put it, “You can never walk down the same city block twice.”The adage certainly holds true in Sunset Park, one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Over the years, it has been predominantly Scandinavian, then Irish and Italian, then Puerto Rican and then Mexican. Today, Community District 7 — bordered by 15th Street to the north, Eighth Avenue or Fort Hamilton Parkway to the east, 65th Street to the south and the waterfront to the west — is largely Latino and Asian. The number of non-Hispanic whites increased almost 8 percent between the 2000 and 2010 census, but that demographic group is still a minority.As for its character, Sunset Park, despite a remarkable housing stock that is attracting those priced out of so-called brownstone Brooklyn, shares more than a bit of the grittiness of the industrial waterfront. Mr. Murphy said that is part of the neighborhood’s charm.“We’re not about being twee or making the neighborhood clean and nice,” he said. “We like it messy. It’s New York City — it’s the kind of neighborhood that Walt Whitman would have walked through 150 years ago.”",2015-01-02T17:44:05+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/chocolate-factory-in-brooklyn-asks-what-us-gentrifiers.html,1139,1
New York Times,"Uncertainty about the longevity of Saudi Arabia’s king intensified on Friday with the announcement that he was battling pneumonia and needed temporary help from a breathing tube.While a statement from the Saudi royal court said the king, Abdullah, was in stable condition at a hospital, there was no immediate word on his prognosis or a discharge date.The king, who turned 90 in August, has a history of medical problems, and his health is often scrutinized for any hint of a leadership change in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy and regional American ally that is perhaps the world’s most important oil producer.The royal court, in an announcement quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency, said a lung infection had been diagnosed in the king after he was admitted to King Abdulaziz Medical City Hospital in Riyadh, the capital, on Wednesday. Other news services said he was transferred on Thursday to a military hospital.The combination of the king’s age and his latest affliction created new uncertainty over his health. It came against a backdrop of challenges faced by the Saudis on a number of major global issues.The biggest is plunging oil prices, caused in part by Saudi insistence on maintaining current high production levels in an effort to drive out higher-cost producers elsewhere and gain more control over the global market.Saudi officials, presumably acting under the king’s orders, have shown no inclination to curb production, despite complaints by others, including the country’s regional rival, Iran.The king’s health difficulties also come as Saudi Arabia, concerned about violent religious extremism, has exerted itself more forcibly in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Most notably, Saudi Arabia is actively participating in the American-led bombing campaign against the Islamic State and other extremist groups involved in those conflicts.Crown Prince Salman, 79, a half brother of the king and his presumed successor, has increasingly acted as Abdullah’s representative, most recently standing in for him at a summit meeting of Persian Gulf countries last month in Qatar. Crown Prince Salman is also Saudi Arabia’s deputy prime minister and defense minister.Another half brother, Prince Muqrin, 69, who has served in a number of top government positions, including the head of intelligence and the king’s special adviser, was made second in line to the throne last March.Abdullah is the country’s sixth king, having assumed the throne in 2005.Despite the succession plan for Abdullah, a bigger question looming in Saudi Arabia’s future is the royal gerontocracy. Its members, many of them stooped and frail, are all sons of King Abdulaziz al-Saud, who founded the kingdom in 1932.Placing Crown Prince Salman and Prince Muqrin in line to succeed Abdullah effectively delays the time of reckoning when the next generation of princes, the founder’s grandsons, will be moved into positions of high authority.The deference to age within the Saudi monarchy partly explains the glacial pace of social change in the kingdom, where strict Islamic codes of conduct are enforced and women have far fewer rights than men.",2015-01-02T18:05:47+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/middleeast/saudi-king-abdullah-is-hospitalized-with-pneumonia.html,507,4
New York Times,"The Obama administration doubled down on Friday on its allegation that North Korea’s leadership was behind the hacking of Sony Pictures, announcing new, if largely symbolic, economic sanctions against 10 senior North Korean officials and the intelligence agency it said was the source of “many of North Korea’s major cyberoperations.”The actions were based on an executive order President Obama signed on vacation in Hawaii, as part of what he had promised would be a “proportional response” against the country. But in briefings for reporters, officials said they could not establish that any of the 10 officials had been directly involved in the destruction of much of the studio’s computing infrastructure. In fact, most seemed linked to the North’s missile and weapons sales. Two are senior North Korean representatives in Iran, a major buyer of North Korean military technology, and five others are representatives in Syria, Russia, China and Namibia.The sanctions were a public part of the response to the cyberattack on Sony, which was targeted as it prepared to release “The Interview,” a crude comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader.The administration has said there would be a covert element of its response as well. Officials sidestepped questions about whether the United States was involved in bringing down North Korea’s Internet connectivity to the outside world over the past two weeks. Perhaps the most noticeable element of the announcement was the administration’s effort to push back on the growing chorus of doubters about the evidence that the attack on Sony was North Korean in origin. Several cybersecurity firms have argued that when Mr. Obama took the unusual step of naming the North’s leadership — on Dec. 19 the president declared that “North Korea engaged in this attack” — he had been misled by American intelligence agencies that were too eager to blame a longtime adversary and allowed themselves to be duped by ingenious hackers skilled at hiding their tracks.But Mr. Obama’s critics do not have a consistent explanation of who might have been culpable. Some blame corporate insiders or an angry former employee, a theory Sony Pictures’ top executive, Michael Lynton, has denied. Others say it was the work of outside hacking groups that were simply using the release of “The Interview” as cover for their actions. Both the F.B.I. and Mr. Obama’s aides used the sanctions announcement to argue that the critics of the administration’s decision to attribute the attack to North Korea have no access to the classified evidence that led the intelligence agencies, and Mr. Obama, to their conclusion.“We remain very confident in the attribution,” a senior administration official who has been at the center of the Sony case told reporters in a briefing that, under guidelines set by the White House, barred the use of the briefer’s name. Still, the administration is clearly stung by the comparisons to the George W. Bush administration’s reliance on faulty intelligence assessments about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 American-led invasion of the country. They note how rare it is for Mr. Obama, usually cautious on intelligence issues, to blame a specific country so directly. But they continue to insist that they cannot explain the basis of the president’s declaration without revealing some of the most sensitive sources and technologies at their disposal.By naming 10 individuals at the center of the North’s effort to sell or obtain weapons technology, the administration seemed to be trying to echo sanctions that the Bush administration imposed eight years ago against a Macao bank that the North Korean leadership used to buy goods illicitly and to reward loyalists. President Bush, speaking to reporters one evening in the White House, argued that those sanctions were the only ones that got the attention of Kim Jong-il, whose son has ruled the country since his death in 2011.In another sign of how Mr. Obama was seeking to punish individual leaders, the executive order he signed gives the Treasury Department broad authority to name anyone in the country’s leadership believed to be involved in illicit activity, and to take action against the Workers’ Party, which has complete control of North Korea’s politics.In a statement, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew suggested that the sanctions were intended not only to punish North Korea for the hacking of Sony — which resulted in the destruction of about three-quarters of the computers and servers at the studio’s main operations — but also to warn the country not to try anything like it again.“Today’s actions are driven by our commitment to hold North Korea accountable for its destructive and destabilizing conduct,” Mr. Lew said. “Even as the F.B.I. continues its investigation into the cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend U.S. businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States.”Beyond the initial sanctions, the power of the president’s order might come from its breadth and its use in the future. One senior official said the order would allow the Treasury to impose sanctions on any person who is an official of the North Korean government or of the Worker’s Party or anyone judged “controlled by the North Korean government” or acting on its behalf.Yet it is easy to overestimate the impact of sanctions. Six decades of efforts to isolate North Korea have not stopped it from building and testing a nuclear arsenal, launching terrorist attacks on the South, testing missiles or maintaining large prison camps.In addition, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the country’s main intelligence organization, has long been under heavy sanctions for directing the country’s arms trade, including the Proliferation Security Initiative, an effort started by the Bush administration to intercept the sales of missiles and other arms.Still, the Treasury’s statement on Friday that “many of North Korea’s major cyberoperations run through R.G.B.” was more than has been said publicly by the United States about how the North Koreans structure their cyberoperations. And administration officials insisted again that the Sony attack “clearly crossed a threshold,” in the words of one senior official, from “website defacement and digital graffiti” to an attack on computer infrastructure.",2015-01-02T19:01:01+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/us/in-response-to-sony-attack-us-levies-sanctions-on-10-north-koreans.html,1045,1

New York Times,"UNITED NATIONS — The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad H. Mansour, formally submitted papers for the Palestinians to join the treaty creating the International Criminal Court, paving the way for the tribunal to potentially investigate serious crimes on Palestinian lands committed by either side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The submission of the documents comes two days after the President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority signed papers acceding to the Rome Statute, which created the court in 2002. According to that treaty, the court, which is based in The Hague, could have authority over Palestinian territory as early as April 1. Israel is not one of the court’s members.“We are honored to be the 123rd state party to the I.C.C.,” Mr. Mansour said Friday. The Palestinians have had the right to join the court since November 2012, when they became a “nonmember observer state” of the United Nations General Assembly.Among the conventions and treaties the Palestinians signed are those that concern cluster munitions and the rights of women. Mr. Mansour said the Palestinians had also asked the court to retroactively examine potential crimes dating to last summer’s war in Gaza.Israel vowed to “take steps in response” if the Palestinians tried to join the court, according to a statement this week from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",2015-01-02T19:55:12+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/middleeast/palestinians-submit-papers-to-un-to-join-international-criminal-court.html,217,6
New York Times,"Cosmologists celebrated the new year by launching a new experiment on a balloon in Antarctica to investigate the Big Bang.A set of six telescopes known as Spider, for Suborbital Polarimeter for Inflation, Dust and the Epoch of Reionization, will circle the continent for the next 20 days, observing a haze of faint microwave radio waves that envelop space and are thought to be the fading remnants of the primordial fireball in which it all started 13.8 billion years ago.The telescopes, built by an international collaboration led by physicists from Caltech and Princeton, are designed to detect faint curlicues in the polarization of the microwaves. According to a widely held theory known as inflation, such curls would have been caused by violent disruptions of space-time when the universe as we know it began expanding, a sliver of a moment after time as we think we understand it began.Spider is a sister experiment to another Caltech-based collaboration known as Bicep, whose investigators made headlines last spring when they announced they had recorded the curlicues in one patch of sky from a telescope at the South Pole, confirming inflation. The scientists later had to concede that most or all of their signal could have been caused by interstellar dust.Spider, on this flight, will observe the microwaves in two wavelengths (“colors” in radio astronomy jargon) that will allow them to distinguish dust from primordial space-time ripples. It will also have the advantage of being above the atmosphere.The Bicep team is just now installing the fourth generation of telescopes at the South Pole and is also observing in multiple wavelengths. Bicep2, which made the news last spring, looked at only one wavelength.Both experiments were conceived by Andrew Lange, a Caltech astronomer who died in 2010. The Spider experiment was supposed to complete the first of two flights last year, but after the equipment was shipped to McMurdo Station, run by the National Science Foundation, the government shut down.“It took the better part of half the year to get all our equipment back from the field and the rest of the year to refurbish and test it all,” said William Jones of Princeton, a leader of the Spider experiment, in an email from Antarctica a few hours before the launch.Subsequently, Dr. Jones reported that instrument was at altitude and doing well. “Going great,” he said in another email, adding, “Science data look good.”",2015-01-02T19:58:05+0000,Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/science/big-bang-to-be-investigated-from-balloon-in-antarctica.html,405,11
New York Times,"Just north of 110th Street, on a stretch of Second Avenue with a pawnshop, a laundromat and a couple of bodegas, a single velvet rope at No. 2145 signals something out of the ordinary. On a recent cold night, a bouncer kept a watchful eye while two hostesses, wearing short dresses despite the temperature, swiped their tablets’ touch screens, trying to free up space inside.It was a strange sight. But from the velvet rope to the diverse clientele crowding the bar under an oversize portrait of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., this is exactly what Jimmy Mateus pictured when he conceived of Ricardo Steak House. “The kitchen’s open, the music’s loud, we sit you close together,” said Mr. Mateus, a 41-year-old contractor who founded the restaurant with his brother, Eddie, in 2004. “That’s by design, to create that energy.”For one regular from Mount Vernon, N.Y., a man who gave his name as Michael Hunt but went by “Money Mike,” that energy is the draw.“This is the new Shark Bar,” said Mr. Hunt, referring to the popular Upper West Side soul food restaurant that closed in 2010. “You’ve got the same quality of people. And the menu is longer.”Like Shark Bar in its heyday, Ricardo is an unapologetic party spot, attracting people of all walks, races and ages, along with various minor celebrities. (Recently seen at Ricardo: the talk show host Wendy Williams and Cyrus R. Vance Jr., Manhattan’s district attorney. Not together, though.)“We’ll often have some top brass sitting right next to a young urban crew, or a couple of Wall Street guys near people coming in from the Bronx,” Mr. Mateus said.Representing the Bronx that night was Shareena Conyers, who was celebrating her 35th birthday. It was her first trip to Ricardo, and she and five female cousins appeared to be having a great time.“We had heard the food was good — and the drinks, really good,” Ms. Conyers said between sips of her Crash Boat, the house cocktail, which contained nine types of liquor. “More importantly, there’s a live D.J.”The person at the turntables wields a singular power: Play the right ’90s jam, and half the joint will drop their conversations to sing along. On that night, the privilege belonged to D.J. Ronny Ron.“There’s no pressure,” he said as he considered what might best follow “Hot Boy” by Bobby Shmurda. “You don’t have to worry about having people dance too much.”In this environment, it is easy to forget about the food. All of the meats are butchered on the premises, so chefs can order individual cuts. But even the menu is designed to crack a smile, with items like the O.G. of Steaks (a porterhouse) and Tap That Bass (a Chilean sea bass). Ricardo’s specialty pays homage to Michael Jackson: the P-Y-T-Bone.The decade-old steakhouse is now preparing to expand. Mr. Mateus, who said he grew up “broke” on the Lower East Side, recently bought an adjacent property. If all goes well, by next autumn, the restaurant will have three floors, a year-round roof deck and a private mezzanine.While the tunes vary from night to night, you are guaranteed to hear one song over and over: “In Da Club,” by 50 Cent. As the hook plays — “Go shorty, it’s your birthday” — workers deliver a sundae to a celebrating patron.Eventually, the focus was on Ms. Conyers. Her waiter brought a martini glass of ice cream, with a sparkler shooting a two-foot pyrotechnic stream. But at this point, she seemed to be feeling the effects of a food coma — or the Crash Boat — and she picked at the brownie at the bottom, disinterested.Then the song changed. “This is my ringtone!” she shrieked, as she raised her arms and began to shimmy in her seat.",2015-01-02T20:11:04+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/at-ricardo-steak-house-theyre-gonna-party-like-its-your-birthday.html,643,3
New York Times,"If you read wedding announcements, you may have noticed that members of the clergy do not matter as much as they used to. More and more people are married by judges, or justices of the peace, or friends who get officiating privileges from the state. Others use what we might call “clergy lite,” ordained by online services like the Universal Life Church, which has but two tenets — “To promote freedom of religion” and “To do that which is right” — and requires only your name and email address and a promise that you are “over the age of 13.”Full disclosure: I am a Universal Life minister, and have performed one wedding. But millions of Americans are still married by traditional ministers, priests, rabbis and other clergy members. They are generally granted a special role in weddings, as officers of the state. They can sign your marriage license, and when they do, it all becomes official. It is an obvious commingling of church and state, one to which most Americans have been amenable. Letting a minister sign the license recognizes that most people want their marriage ceremony to be both sacramental and civil.But as same-sex marriage becomes the law in more states — at last count, 35 states, plus the District of Columbia — some clergy members who are opposed to same-sex marriage are discovering that being officers of the state puts them in an awkward position. They are signing marriage licenses that get filed with a state government whose laws, they believe, are undermining traditional notions of marriage. And so a few of them have said, in effect, “No more.”In its December issue, the conservative Christian magazine First Things published “The Marriage Pledge,” by Christopher Seitz and Ephraim Radner, both Episcopal priests and theologians who teach at Wycliffe College in Toronto. The pledge commits clergy members not to sign “government-provided marriage certificates.” Its online version has attracted 370 signers.“In many jurisdictions,” Dr. Seitz and Dr. Radner write, “including many of the United States, civil authorities have adopted a definition of marriage that explicitly rejects the age-old requirement of male-female pairing.” Therefore, to continue “with church practices that intertwine government marriage with Christian marriage will implicate the church in a false definition of marriage.”The authors promise to “ask couples to seek civil marriage separately from their church-related vows and blessings.” And they “will preside only at those weddings that seek to establish a Christian marriage in accord with the principles articulated and lived out from the beginning of the church’s life.” In practice, they ask couples to be married in Christian rites with ministers or priests, then to have second services, with judges or justices of the peace, who will sign their state licenses.R. R. Reno, a Catholic ethicist who edits First Things, said that he and fellow traditionalists had been mulling over such a statement for a while.“It’s an idea that has been tossed around in our circles for, gosh, at least the last five years,” said Dr. Reno, whose “circles” include the highly intellectual, mostly Catholic roster of First Things contributors. He said that in 2010, when First Things held a private symposium about the future of marriage for “maybe 20 or 25” theologians, the Duke theologian Paul J. Griffiths suggested separating civil from religious marriage. Most in attendance were against the move.“But in the last year,” Dr. Reno said, “I could tell that people’s sentiments had shifted pretty strongly, and people who had spoken against this idea were thinking maybe it’s the right thing to do.”It is a radical step, of course, one that abdicates a major privilege of the clergy. And there have been many dissenters, who view the pledge as a retreat in a culture war that is far from over. At MereOrthodoxy.com, one writer called the pledge “a posture that attempts to look courageous and prophetic but that is actually a timid, meek act of surrender.” In a web column, the radio host John Stonestreet wrote that “by backing out of the civil marriage business,” Christians would “risk perpetuating that illusion that marriage is something the government defines instead of something it recognizes.”The pledge has exposed fault lines in the conservative Christian world. First, it raises the quarrel between those who would engage with culture and those who would separate from it. Second, there is the slightly different question of the church’s relationship not to culture, but to the government. (In his MereOrthodoxy.com post, Jake Meador neatly summarizes that conflict as one between two famous English Christians, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.)And then there are the differences between Catholics, who are embedded in a robust hierarchy and have little personal autonomy in their faith, and Protestants, whose worshipers, and clergy members, typically have more latitude in interpreting what theology requires of them, and are thus freer to take radical personal stands.“It’s not a decision Catholic priests are free to decide,” said Holly Taylor Coolman, a theologian at Providence College. “In the Catholic tradition, marriage is a communally discerned and practiced phenomenon. When priests are functioning as priests, there is much more at stake than their individual consciences.”Dr. Coolman added that Catholic tradition recognizes areas besides marriage in which an act of the state ineluctably coincides with a religious act. As an example, she said that she was an adoptive parent.“I became a parent through a legal process,” Dr. Coolman said. “But as somebody functioning in the Christian tradition, that is exactly the moment I took up what I understood to be the Christian vocation of parenthood.” In other words, the state’s adoption papers effected what for her was a Christian act, becoming a parent.Chad Pecknold, who teaches at the Catholic University of America, suggested that signing the pledge could actually represent a form of pastoral malpractice, by absenting the minister or priest from a congregant’s major life decision.“The pledge actually shifts any burden of conscience from ordained ministers to their flock,” Dr. Pecknold said. “It’s a kind of shocking vocational failure, to recommend that pastors shouldn’t sign these things,” he said, referring to marriage licenses.“Their flock is going to have to sign,” he continued, “unless they want to give up the legal benefits of marriage.”Dr. Seitz, one of the pledge’s authors, said that as an academic he does not “do the kind of weddings on a regular basis as someone whose full-time job” is in the clergy. And many of those who have signed his pledge appear to be laypeople, or women in traditions in which women do not perform weddings. Like them, he is mostly an observer, and one of his observations is that we are in “a funny time.”If marriage moves toward becoming just “a contract between two people, the state can take care of that,” Dr. Seitz said. “And it makes a lot of sense — property, custody of children.” But he believes that marriage needs more, and that the state may be weakening, rather than enhancing, the customs and mores that uphold the institution.Dr. Radner, the pledge’s other author, is on sabbatical in France, which has long separated religious marriage from civil marriage. Seeing the separation up close has only made him more of a fan.“Just living here made me realize that the church can function rather well,” he said, “and also avoid some of the conflict that we seem to get all embroiled in in the U.S. over sexuality matters, by being somewhat disentangled, practically, from the civil marriage system.”",2015-01-02T20:14:31+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/us/gay-marriage-prompts-a-call-for-clergy-to-shun-civil-ceremonies.html,1265,12
New York Times,"The three-minute ride was just long enough to give a taste of what could be.The old rail car with the fancy name — the Bronxstack Continental — roared through the Harlem River Yard, an industrial site in the South Bronx. The open-air car carried passengers bundled in winter jackets and scarves, as it shuttled back and forth through a landscape of steel bridges, rough-hewn buildings and chain-link fencing topped with barbed wire.Anthony Ramirez II, a co-founder of Mainland Media, which operates the Bronx Beer Hall on Arthur Avenue, held on as the Bronxstack Continental, a small work car known as a speeder, lurched forward after hitting a bump. “My experience with trains has really been the subway, and this is way more exciting,” he said.Mr. Ramirez is part of a group of Bronx residents, train enthusiasts, historians and others who want to bring such rides to the borough and New York City as a way to repurpose stretches of little-used or abandoned railroad tracks for recreational use. They envision opening the tracks to everyone with their own rail car, or access to one, which, like the transformation of the old Manhattan freight line into the High Line park, could potentially draw tourists and dollars to an economically struggling neighborhood.“The closest you can come to this is the monorail at the Bronx Zoo,” said Ed Garcia Conde, the founder and editor of Welcome2theBronx, a borough-focused blog, adding that he would like to see rail car rides incorporated into redevelopment efforts for the South Bronx waterfront. “This is a beautiful example of what could happen here. Just imagine this green instead of concrete.”But such ambitions remain just that for now, largely because of the myriad logistical, safety and financial issues involved in adapting rail lines for more widespread use. Freight rail remains a tiny but growing part of the New York region’s overall transportation system. The total volume of freight shipments is expected to rise to 15.1 million tons by 2040, from 10.2 million tons in 2007, according to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, a regional organization charged with transportation planning.William Goetz, a vice president of CSX Transportation, one of the nation’s largest freight railroad companies, said that most tracks are actively used, and that running a personal rail car on them would require approval from the rail owners as well as careful planning and coordination to avoid any accidents. “Railroad tracks are not a place for anyone to go uninvited,” he said. “The movement of equipment on an operating railroad is heavily regulated. It’s not like a city street where you can get a driver’s license.”Still, Mr. Goetz did not rule out the possibility of allowing the Bronxstack Continental on CSX tracks. “We’ll take it one step at a time,” said Mr. Goetz, who was on hand recently to observe the car’s test run at the Harlem River Yard. “It’s not something we’d normally do. Safety is the critical thing.”The rail-car group was organized by Justin Fornal, 37, who is known to fans as the culinary adventurer Baron Ambrosia,  the host of several media projects devoted to the Bronx and its food. In 2011, Mr. Fornal and his father, John, bought a used rail car for $3,500 from a retired railroad worker in Monroe, N.Y. They parked it at the elder Mr. Fornal’s home in Killingworth, Conn., where they overhauled it, renamed it and painted it light purple, his son’s signature color.The younger Mr. Fornal said he was working on a plan to take the Bronxstack Continental public next spring, running it on tracks around the city while picking up and dropping off passengers. Eventually, he said, he hoped to make a cross-country trip to build support for what he saw as an urban take on a pastime in which people buy speeders — compact, motorized rail cars usually used for maintenance — to ride on tracks in mostly rural areas.Tony Riccio, a senior vice president of Harlem River Yard Ventures, a private development company that leases the rail yard from New York State, said he received a call from Mr. Fornal asking permission to use the tracks. “He had this idea, which was crazy,” Mr. Riccio recalled. “Why would someone say he would want to go from the East Coast to the West Coast on abandoned rail lines? That’s not exactly sanity.”Still, Mr. Riccio agreed to open the yard to Mr. Fornal and the rest of the group for test runs last month and was one of the first to climb aboard. It was a smoother ride than he expected, he said.The rail car, powered by a four-cylinder gas-burning engine, was christened with a bottle of sparkling birch sap wine and toasted by more than three dozen people. Then Mr. Fornal, dressed for the occasion in pinstripe overalls and an engineer’s cap, called out “all aboard” for the first ride.“It’s like a toy train but bigger,” said James Sexton, 48, an architectural historian from New Rochelle, N.Y., who compared the excursion to cruising in a convertible.But Mr. Sexton said he would not be getting a rail car of his own.“I’m going to bum rides with Baron,” he said. “I don’t think my wife would be happy if I parked a speeder in the driveway.”",2015-01-02T20:35:04+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/in-the-bronx-test-driving-a-plan-to-open-railroad-tracks-to-the-public.html,890,1
New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan — A series of kidnappings and robberies struck northern Helmand Province this summer, paralyzing residents and embarrassing the Taliban leaders who controlled the area.Responding to growing complaints, the Taliban leadership based in Pakistan ordered a hunt to find the criminals, but soon discovered an inconvenient truth: Their own people were behind the banditry, earning thousands of dollars in ransoms every month. Within a matter of days, the culprits had been captured and executed, including two notorious fighters known as Pickax and Shovel.Though the episode went largely unnoticed outside the Taliban stronghold, it highlights a question that is on the minds of many: More than 13 years after the war here started, who exactly are the Taliban? Are they the bandits responsible for the abduction and killings of numerous villagers? Or are they the disciplined leaders who hanged the fighters who had taken to criminal tyranny?Increasingly, it appears, they are both.More than a decade of constant fighting has deeply changed the movement that the American-led invasion helped remove from power in 2001. Much of the cadre of fighters that first rose up to battle rapacious warlords during the country’s civil war has been killed or remains in exile. On the ground, the movement now relies on a mixed bag of members, many of whom fight under the banner of the Taliban but bear no resemblance to the spiritual movement of the 1990s.The significant military gains the Taliban made in the past year have focused new attention on the group’s character and challenges, as its leaders try to make the case to Afghans that they are stronger and more legitimate rulers than the American-backed government.Some of the Taliban factions pressing their military goals remain idealists, but many are basically criminals who have used the Taliban brand to further their lucrative enterprises in the opium trade and commodity smuggling, Afghan and Western officials say.Still others have splintered from the mainstream Taliban, having grown more extreme and less inclined to engage in peace talks. A recent report from the United Nations Security Council said that much of the movement was “opposed to reconciliation” with the government, and it said the likelihood that the Taliban’s core leadership could break the internal stalemate was “slim.”“The old Taliban leadership is aging, and they have lost their ability to exert command and control from Pakistan,” said Karl W. Eikenberry, a former American ambassador to Afghanistan. “They lost credibility with younger fighters, but also their grasp of day-to-day combat.”Part of the reason is that battlefield losses to the coalition military campaign have forced a major turnover within the Taliban’s ranks. Scores of midlevel Taliban commanders have been killed and replaced in the last decade, leaving a young and more hardened set of field leaders in their place with less connection to the leadership of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the reclusive emir of the movement who has not been spotted since the war started.“This movement is heavily fragmented and held together by a piece of string and a prayer,” said Alex Strick van Linschoten, a researcher and an author of the book “An Enemy We Created: The Myth of the Taliban-Al Qaeda Merger in Afghanistan.” Mr. van Linschoten added, “Mullah Omar is burdened with all of this weight, and he is more or less keeping this movement together — or at least the idea of him.”From the highest levels of the central organization led by Mullah Omar, known as the Quetta Shura, the group is clearly trying to signal that it is moving away from some of the hard-line policies and practices that defined its harsh rule from 1996 to 2001. A spokesman for the group denies that the kidnappings in Helmand this summer were perpetrated by true Taliban fighters.In some Afghan areas under Taliban sway, it is not uncommon to hear stories of a more farsighted governing style. Insurgent commanders have opened girls’ schools in some places and operate court systems that are seen as fairer and more effective than the government’s. In some cases, they attend weddings with music without a word of consternation — once unthinkable for a group that banned musical instruments and performances. And the group has been calculatedly aggressive about its publicity campaign on social media.ImageTayab Agha, far right, a spokesman for the central Taliban leadership, in 2001. Much has changed in Afghanistan since then.Credit...Ruth Fremson/The New York TimesIn short, some leading Taliban have seized on the need to capture hearts and minds.“They have a much more realistic perspective on what government is now,” said one senior Western diplomat. “They are much more realistic about things. One thing they learned is that if they want to come back and take over Afghanistan, they can’t be at war with everybody.”“The Afghan people have a lot of expectations now,” the official added, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.But that perspective is not the whole story. Across the country, villagers living under Taliban control offer a far more complicated picture. Many feel the Taliban have hardly changed at all. They still inflict brutal policies in some areas under their control and are merciless with villagers who cross them. Some refuse to listen to the directives of the Quetta Shura, going their own way in how they fight and rule.Kunar Province provides an interesting case study of the disagreements.Even those living in the same district cannot agree on what is happening. The district governor of Marawara says that the government controls 75 percent of the area and that the Taliban have been on a charm offensive to win back popular support. But an elder in the same area says the exact opposite: that the Taliban control 75 percent of the territory and are worse than ever.“There has not been a single percent change in their ideology,” said Hajji Pacha, an elder from the district. “They are still the same bastards.” Some Taliban leaders, including those among the network of shadow governors that ultimately answers to the Quetta Shura, claim they have been unfairly saddled with a bad reputation for behavior long since past.“It is very true that we used to have many cruel and imprudent people among us who were misusing their supremacy by harassing ordinary people or beating them,” said Ershad Zazai, the Taliban shadow governor of the Sarkano district of Kunar Province. “But now we do not have such people in our group, or they have changed their behavior because we do not have ruthlessness in the principles of the Islamic Emirate.”In that respect, the only consistent element of Taliban intelligence is that there is no consistency. Even Western analysts who study the group have differing views on its direction, success and cohesion.Still, many ask how the group could have made the gains it did this summer — killing a record number of policemen and soldiers — if its structure is supposedly so incoherent.One explanation is simply that the gains are explained more by government weakness than by Taliban strength.“The officials are not in touch with the local people,” said Hajji Zahir, an elder in the Marko district of Nangarhar Province, which has seen a large upswing in violence. “They have closed the door on the people — the people do not trust them and so the government cannot go out.”And while much has changed since 2001, there are still some areas, especially in the Pashtun heartland in the south and east, that value the Taliban way of life and moral code.“The Taliban still carries the banner of Islamic morals,” said another senior diplomat with extensive experience in the country. “The Taliban still grabs people’s minds. And in a fight about who is right, you must gain the minds of the people.”“Afghans are not looking for many things, mostly justice and security,” the diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly, added. “There is no justice in this government. There is justice under the Taliban.”",2015-01-02T20:40:26+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/asia/taliban-bid-to-capture-hearts-along-with-territory-hurt-by-unruly-factions.html,1323,1

Chau Lam and Alan Wong sat at a prime table with Ms. Lam’s niece, Isabelle Wein, and her friend, Elise Eckhoff, discussing the relative merits of this rink versus the ones in Rockefeller Center and Bryant Park. (In summary: It is much less crowded downtown). Ms. Lam, 44, is a reporter at Newsday; Mr. Wong, 48, works in I.T. support. The girls, both 14, were visiting from Orlando, Fla. It was their last day in New York.WHY THEY CAME “I just wanted to show them the Winter Garden,” Ms. Lam said, referring to the giant vaulted hall and its towering palm trees. The group had come from the South Street Seaport, where the rink was closed, and planned to see a Broadway show in the evening. “This is absolutely gorgeous,” she added. “It’s just one of my favorite places to go, particularly in the wintertime. In the summer we take our bikes here.”In fact, they had not planned on skating at Brookfield Place, Mr. Wong said. “We just walked down the steps and all the sudden we saw the rink and saw people on the ice, and the next thing you know they’re on the ice.” They had been scared off by the crowds at the other rinks. Ms. Lam and Mr. Wong chose to watch from inside. Each had a reason.“It’s too cold,” Ms. Lam said.“We’re too old,” Mr. Wong said.ON THE PLATES Apparently the group did not get the memo about cocoa’s performance-enhancing effects on skaters, because the girls drank tea with milk, and everyone shared side orders of baked beans. Those downtown iconoclasts! “We had a late breakfast,” Ms. Lam explained. The tea was from Olive’s ($2.50); the beans from Mighty Quinn’s ($5.75).WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT “We were just discussing how well they were skating, because at first they were just taking baby steps,” Ms. Lam said. The girls said they did not get a lot of opportunities to skate in Orlando, so they were nervous when they first got on the ice.“We were really wobbly,” Elise said. “At the end we ended up gliding more.”Isabelle added: “We were talking about how proud we were of ourselves. Because we were really scared at first. I was scared to try gliding, but it went well.”",2015-01-02T20:43:05+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/on-or-just-near-the-ice-at-brookfield-place.html,552,3
New York Times,"INTENDENTE ALVEAR, Argentina — An American who sought refuge in Argentina after he was accused of killing his wife in 2002 should be sent back to the United States, Argentina’s Supreme Court announced this week.The decision to extradite the American, Kurt Sonnenfeld, who moved to Argentina in 2003 after prosecutors in Denver charged him with first-degree murder, ends a long dispute between the United States Justice Department and local courts in Argentina.Mr. Sonnenfeld, who has claimed that he has proof that the American government had prior knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks, and who has gained a following among like-minded conspiracy theorists, has said the government and prosecutors colluded to frame him for his wife’s death in order to silence him. The Denver district attorney’s office has denied these allegations.Argentina’s courts had rejected extradition requests from the Justice Department, saying the district attorney’s office could not guarantee Mr. Sonnenfeld would be spared the death penalty in Colorado if convicted. But in a new ruling, the Argentine Supreme Court said it now had the assurances it needed to approve the extradition of Mr. Sonnenfeld.ImageKurt SonnenfeldCredit...John Prieto/The Denver Post, via Associated PressHowever, one of the judges added, it was granting the extradition request on the condition that if Mr. Sonnenfeld were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, there would be a provision for his parole. The judges said a sentence without the possibility of parole would violate Argentina’s Constitution.Mr. Sonnenfeld, who is reported to be in his 50s, has requested political asylum in Argentina. He arrived in Buenos Aires a little more than a year after his wife was found by the police, slumped on a sofa in a bedroom at their Denver home on Jan. 1, 2002. She had been shot through the head. Mr. Sonnenfeld, who remarried in Argentina, has said his wife committed suicide.Prosecutors dropped initial murder charges against him in mid-2002 because of insufficient evidence. New charges were later filed, and Mr. Sonnenfeld was arrested in Argentina and briefly jailed.He had been a cameraman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, sent to the World Trade Center shortly after the attacks of 2001 to document the aftermath. He said the video footage he collected indicated that the government had known about the attacks ahead of time.Mr. Sonnenfeld accused the government of hacking into his email and tapping his telephone calls. He has appeared in the news media in Argentina and written a book, published in Spanish, called “El Perseguido” (“The Persecuted”).",2015-01-02T20:49:04+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/americas/argentina-to-extradite-kurt-sonnenfeld-9-11-truther-on-murder-charge.html,411,6
New York Times,"Sharon Isbin’s living room is decorated with two Grammy Awards and a keepsake from her time performing in the Amazon: a handcrafted poison-dart gun. (It does not work.) She lives on the Upper West Side with a view of the Hudson River and of a statue of her heroine, Eleanor Roosevelt. Ms. Isbin, a 58-year-old classical guitarist, has been a trailblazer both for female musicians and for the guitar’s place in the classical music world. She is the director of guitar programs at the Juilliard School and at the Aspen Music Festival, and will tour again this spring. A documentary on public television, “Sharon Isbin: Troubadour,” explores her musical beginnings in Italy, her teenage years in Minnesota and her lifelong collaborations with composers.PEACE AT LAST Unless there is something special happening, I am not setting the alarm on Sunday. Now that I have the added challenge of my neighbors’ renovation going on, I am awakened by jackhammers very often at 9 in the morning, so Saturday and Sunday are the days I look forward to the most.ImageMeditating at home on the Upper West Side.Credit...Andrew Renneisen for The New York TimesON THE RUN If the weather is good, a run is in order. I feel energized and invigorated and ready to face the day. I usually run for about 25 minutes. I go about two and a half miles, around 10:30, 11, as late as possible. I don’t even own, what do they call it, one of those iPod things? I want to take it all in, hear the birds and whatever is out there. I don’t know how people run with music because it’s a different rhythm and the wrong rhythm, and as a musician it would be a confusing thing.MEDITATION BREAK I have done Transcendental Meditation since I was 17 years old. I do 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon. I really believe it has helped make me the person that I am. Because it is an extraordinary way to release stress and allow it to dissolve, so that you can focus on what you want to focus on, and have your energy towards very positive things.ImageTaking a private dance lesson with Mladen Iliev.Credit...Andrew Renneisen for The New York TimesALL ORGANIC I look forward to making my morning smoothie, which is organic banana, frozen, with organic blueberry, organic strawberry, organic cranberries. I grind my own organic flax. Then I add nonfat Greek yogurt, organic. You probably don’t want to use organic 20 times or people will say, ‘Boy, she’s a drag!’ Only on Sundays do I have time to make my own oatmeal. I toast sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, put them inside the oatmeal, add cinnamon and I am set for the day.COLLABORATION I try to catch up on some work things that have piled up. I am busy preparing two world premieres, which can take 10 years out of your life. The first will be a concerto by Chris Brubeck, the son of composer David Brubeck. The other is a co-commission by Carnegie Hall and the Harris Theater in Chicago to have the composer of my choice, Richard Danielpour, write a song cycle for me and the mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard. Sunday is not a day of rest.ImageDining at Mana with Anne Nelson, a friend.Credit...Andrew Renneisen for The New York TimesCOORDINATION I take dance lessons at Fred Astaire. Sunday is great because the place is much quieter and empty. If you’re learning a routine where you have to memorize steps — that is more challenging than anything else I have done. The guitar, I know my way around it. Figuring out how to move my right foot and left foot in coordination with my hands, that’s a whole different process.COMFORT FOOD My favorite restaurant in New York is Mana, which is an organic, vegetarian place on Amsterdam and 91st Street. Mana is my go-to, it’s home-cooking, it’s just delicious, it’s not fancy, and I feel like I am nourishing every part of myself when I go there.SCREEN TIME After dinner, I would probably get suckered into email on the computer and never emerge. I don’t usually have time to watch television, but if I do, it’s some nature show. I was just watching “A Sloth Named Velcro.” And I did watch the complete Roosevelt series.GOING TO SLEEP Depends on what deadline I am on. It can be anywhere from midnight to 4.

New York Times,"NEW DELHI — India said on Friday that its coast guard had intercepted a suspicious Pakistan-based fishing boat at sea late on New Year’s Eve, but that when Indian officers approached the vessel to investigate, four men aboard the boat set off an “explosion and major fire” that completely destroyed the vessel.Pakistani officials said they believed that the Indian report was a hoax, though they were still trying to investigate the matter.The Indian Defense Ministry said security forces had received repeated warnings of a “threat from the sea,” and had increased their maritime patrols in recent months. The ministry said that Indian officials received intelligence on Wednesday night that a fishing boat “was planning some illicit transaction in the Arabian Sea.”A coast guard patrol ship located the vessel around midnight and attempted to stop it from fleeing by firing warning shots, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.Four men who were seen aboard the vessel refused to cooperate, and then “hid themselves in a below-deck compartment and set the boat on fire,” the statement said. The boat burned and sank in the early hours of New Year’s Day, and darkness and strong winds prevented the coast guard vessel from recovering its remains, the statement said.Indian officials did not say what they thought the four men’s intentions were.Terrorists have entered India by sea in the past.

New York Times,"Thoroughbred horse racing provides one of the great American spectacles: the magnificently chiseled athletes, the elemental contest of speed and power, the libidinal rush of personal fortunes won or lost by the margins of a split second.The photographer Theo Zierock, who spent last winter shooting Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, found none of that. What he found instead was a decaying building populated by lonely old men.“Some say it’s a retirement home,” said Mr. Zierock, 24, who came to New York from northern Italy to study photojournalism at the International Center of Photography. “They don’t care much about whether the track is preserved. They just complain about it.”Sanitation and security were poor, Mr. Zierock said. Last year a disabled woman with the mental capacity of a 2-year-old was sexually assaulted in the women’s restroom on Super Bowl Sunday. “There’s a lot of serious psychological damage there,” the photographer said. “Not all of them should be free on the street.”Mr. Zierock said the gamblers initially rebuffed him. But after a month, they opened up. “One guy was divorced,” he said. “One used to be a drag queen. Now he has health issues so he can’t drink or do drugs anymore, so he goes to the track. One guy’s first memory of a racetrack was his father dying of a heart attack at a racetrack. Most of the people had a story like that.”He met only one gambler who consistently won, he said. Everyone else accepted their small losses as the price of a day’s distraction, and the losses of others as a small reward. More than money, Mr. Zierock said, “the thing they like is being right” — making a prediction before a race, then throwing it in the face of the naysayers if it comes true.“That’s why they don’t care if they lose,” he said. “They gamble for gambling’s sake. They know no one wins.”",2015-01-02T21:17:33+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/photographs-at-aqueduct-racetrack-where-horses-race-but-no-one-wins.html,320,8
New York Times,"Tom Eve, 63, still remembers the day in 1958 that the firehouse on his South Bronx block got its new pumper: a gleaming new Mack whose cab could fit five firefighters.It was a Model-C with a Thermodyne engine that purred, compared to the roaring 1939 Ward LaFrance it replaced, recalled Mr. Eve, who even at age 7 was already a fixture around the firehouse, Engine Company 60 and Ladder Company 17, on East 143rd Street.He has not lost his boyish enthusiasm for fire trucks, as attested by the dozens of miniatures crowding the shelves in the basement shop of his house, just off the Staten Island Expressway.Mr. Eve, a retired postal worker, custom builds ultrarealistic models for clients who request replicas of pumpers and ladder trucks — historic or current, from the New York Fire Department or, sometimes, other departments.“My trucks are on shelves all over the world,” he said. “Most of these trucks are ones I’m working on for other people.”The little plastic models may resemble toys, but they can cost upward of $300, and they reflect a lifetime obsession with, and deep knowledge of, New York fire apparatus.Mr. Eve builds the models to be historically accurate, down to the make and model, type of accessories and firehouse insignia. He currently has about 300 trucks between his own collection and those being built for enthusiasts as well as retired New York firefighters wanting a souvenir of their service.“Most firefighters have a favorite truck they worked on that meant a lot to them,” he said. “They feel like, ‘This is the wagon I rode to battle on.’ ”While some clients may furnish photographs and descriptions of the truck they want replicated, it often falls to Mr. Eve to recreate the rig.“It’s second-nature for me because I’ve been a buff for so long — I’ve been studying the trucks since I was a kid,” said Mr. Eve, the son of Dominican immigrants, who grew up down the block from Engine Company 60 where an old buff, Jimmy Ginty, took him under his wing.“Jimmy could remember horse-drawn rigs,” Mr. Eve recalled. “He’d give me pamphlets and memorabilia as old as the hills.”During the 1970s, when “half my neighborhood went to hell” from constant fires, Mr. Eve said, he would follow the trucks to the fires, then help wash and pack up the hoses.He also had an active music career as a guitarist. He formed the band Eve of Eden  in the 1970s, and played with the likes of Luther Vandross and stars from the disco era. These days, he is a sideman with prominent doo-wop groups.He keeps his sheet music stacked next to his library of fire reference materials that include books, magazines and pamphlets about New York fire apparatus.There are decades of WNYF magazine, the official training publication of the Fire Department, and Fire Apparatus Journal. Mr. Eve also has made his own master index of New York fire rigs compiled, he said, from a lifetime of “buffing.” It has minute and historical details on roughly 1,000 rigs used from the 1940s through the 1970s.For most of New York City’s 218 firehouses, Mr. Eve can tick off a detailed list of the assigned rigs, from the past and present. His mind is its own index of makes and models: Macks, Seagraves, Ferraras, Hahns, Howes, Maxims — and the old Ahrens-Fox rigs.“They were the Rolls-Royce of fire apparatus,” he said. “They had the pump in front of the front wheels.”Mr. Eve browses online and at yard and estate sales for truck models that he strips and rebuilds with materials and accessories bought in hobby shops and craft stores. He has drawers full of miniature extinguishers, spotlights, ladders and other parts.Mr. Eve monitors fire emergencies on a scanner and is active with buff groups, including NYC Fire Buffs.“Firefighters tell me, ‘You know more about us than we do,’ ” he said.Sometimes Mr. Eve enlists his wife, Maria — they have seven children between them — to help out. She carved the tiny, plastic steer horns that Mr. Eve was attaching on a recent weekday above the windshield of a tower ladder truck from Ladder Company 13 in the Yorkville section of Manhattan.He pointed out another ladder truck: “An American LaFrance 900 series from the ’60s — I made it from scratch.”“That’s a tough truck,” he said. “It’s lasted me through three marriages.”",2015-01-02T21:36:16+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/five-alarm-obsession-a-fire-truck-buff-custom-builds-models.html,749,4
New York Times,"Among the colorful textiles and Buddhist temple rubbings that decorate the walls of Green Papaya Thai Restaurant, in Canton, hangs a Hmong story cloth that depicts the flight of refugees from Laos into Thailand. This blue fabric, stitched with images of helicopter gunships and people swimming across the Mekong River, is a subtle clue that Green Papaya is not your run-of-the-mill Thai place. At first glance, though, the menu suggests otherwise. Chicken satay — check. Shrimp-filled summer rolls — check. Deep-fried squid with sweet chili sauce — check. But on a lengthy list of Thai standards, the restaurant’s co-owner, Souvanna Loungxay, formerly of Laos, has inserted several more unusual dishes, mostly based on the foods of her native country. ImageDishes include the crisp and crunchy green papaya salad.Credit...Wendy Carlson for The New York Times“Unusual” is a matter of degree. With Laos and Thailand sharing a long border, their cuisines — heavily reliant on coconut curries and such seasonings as lemon grass, garlic, basil, kaffir lime leaf, tamarind, chili peppers and fish sauce — are more similar than different. Yet the differences are what distinguish Green Papaya Thai, which opened in 2013, from most of the other Thai restaurants in Connecticut. With a menu that includes fried rice and various curries and numerous noodle dishes, I was particularly taken by some of the starters. For the curry puffs — four crescents of pastry dough, plump with chicken, onion and tiny bits of potato — the flaky shell and its madras-spiked filling made for an especially agreeable mouthful. Lemon grass chicken, another appetizer, featured more than a dozen nuggets of delicately deep-fried breast meat, with a hint of citrus seeping through light, crispy batter. And I am still dreaming about sai ghock, a house-made sausage of coarsely ground pork that was moist, tender and sparkled with kaffir leaf; it was paired with a fresh-tasting tomato-chili-garlic dipping sauce. I also relished the restaurant’s namesake green papaya salad (som-tum). So many disparate ingredients — matchsticks of pale papaya, paper-thin cuts of carrots, tomatoes, fresh chiles, crushed peanuts, lime juice, fish sauce — that together amounted to a spicy celebration of vibrant flavors and crisp, crunchy textures. By contrast, the larb salad (ordered with beef) that I sampled was a disappointment, but not because of an absence of toasted rice powder, which is de rigueur. On the contrary, the aromatic and flavor contributions of that nutty component were noteworthy. But larb should also be about a balanced interplay of salty fish sauce and bracing lime juice, complemented by a hearty jolt of pepper heat. The larb I had was deficient in all of those factors. ImageDishes also include kai-ka-prow, a house specialty of minced chicken.Credit...Wendy Carlson for The New York TimesThe only other misfires I encountered during several visits to Green Papaya were the chin ping meatballs, an appetizer, and the Thai steamed mussels (listed among the fish entrees). Unlike the sai ghock sausage, which seemed freshly made, the chin ping, while generous in portion, was tough and rubbery. And though I loved the flavorful broth that accompanied the mussels, the mussels themselves (about seven of the gigantic green-rimmed New Zealand variety) had a bland, chewy, previously frozen quality to them. Far more satisfying was choo chee snapper, an entree listed among the house specials. Flour-dipped and deep-fried whole, the impressively large fish was surrounded by sundry vegetables (all pleasingly cooked just shy of al dente) and smothered in a zesty, basil-tinged coconut curry. Another house specialty, kai-ka-prow chicken, was coated in a similar sauce, though with additional complexity contributed by the presence of fish sauce. Despite their designation on the menu as peppery, both dishes were more sweet than spicy, which is probably a concession the kitchen makes to Western tastes. After finding tamarind duck (paired with perfectly steamed baby bok choy) to be as sweet as jaggery (rather than sour-sweet, as its tamarind treatment would suggest), I requested that orders of stir-fried eggplant and Panang duck (moist cuts of breast meat) be prepared “extra hot.” They were, with a sweat-of-the-brow pepperiness that contributed to their savory sauces. In the case of the eggplant, which came with tender, pounded-flat strips of pork and plenty of basil, it was also heavily infused with garlic; the sauce accompanying the Panang duck, with moist slivers of breast meat, kaffir leaf and too many pieces of canned bamboo shoots, was a rich, creamy coconut curry. Either jasmine rice or Laotian sticky rice is offered with nearly every entree. Thus, the restaurant’s best dessert, mango with coconut sticky rice, may seem like a replay of the earlier meal. But with the mango ripe and fresh, and the rice sweetly imbued with coconut milk, it is a replay well worth indulging in.

New York Times,"Does fried avocado sound like a good idea to you? It didn’t to me either. But at the Hudson Room, a happening new space in the heart of Peekskill, it somehow worked. Part of a “shrimp and avocado fry” that included expertly fried Gulf shrimp and chunks of avocado with a side of spicy mustard rémoulade, vegetables and brown rice, the bowl captured the feel of the restaurant: Funky meets sophisticated.The eclectic menu is reflected in the space itself. A former five-and-dime storefront, the Hudson Room is cavernous but manages to seem intimate by creating distinct areas. There is a full bar with backlit shelving to the left of the entrance and a sushi bar to the right. A large stage toward the rear brings music and other acts to the restaurant, and the seating ranges from a group of large rounded leather banquettes facing the stage to smaller tables along the big windows in the front. It looks like fun from the outside, and it is.Much of the food has a welcome spicy kick. Sriracha sauce is featured in the spicy tuna roll and on the seared shrimp with guacamole on crisp little flour tortillas. A special of grilled lamb rack came with a hot mustard/garlic/chipotle crust (and excellent Cheddar mashed potatoes). And the “pink” clam chowder had a peppery taste that brought out the flavors of the soup’s smoky bacon pieces, corn and fennel. That appetizer is made with mostly local ingredients, including cream, courtesy of Lanza Farms in Garrison, which is owned by Louis Lanza, one of the Hudson Room’s four owners.ImageThe menu includes popcorn shrimp.Credit...Gregg Vigliotti for The New York TimesWhen there isn’t heat, the dishes can be less interesting. Rigatoni with meatballs in a red sauce was a bit bland. Orecchiette came with tender pieces of chicken and pork sausage but the sweet cherry peppers could have used more spice and, combined with lemon zest, became a mishmash of tastes. “Loaded fries” — French fries covered with asiago, Parmesan, scallions and truffle oil — sounded intriguing but were mushy, collapsed by overambition.Indeed, some of my favorite items were the simplest. The Hudson roll — Gulf lump crab, cucumber and avocado with a dusting of masago — had a wonderfully clean, sweet flavor. The seared Scottish salmon with a ginger-scallion butter had a great crust, moist meat and a rich taste.The Hudson Room’s mantra is “globally inspired, locally sourced.” There are lots of influences at work — Cajun, Italian, Japanese and more — but also a lovely local feel. Most of the desserts, for example, are made daily by Peekskill’s beloved old-school bakery, Homestyle. (If the mascarpone layer cake is on the menu, it is definitely worth a try, as is the kitchen’s own creamy cheesecake and delicious ice cream.) The bar offers beer from a Japanese craft brewery, a Barolo made with grapes grown in California and an Australian wine made with grapes from Germany and France.It is all a reflection of the ways the culinary world has expanded and gotten more intimate at the same time, so that people are familiar with tastes from around the globe but use them to create something of their own. The owners behind the Hudson Room (in addition to Mr. Lanza, who is also the chef, they are Daniel Steinberger, Cheng Ling and Jose Quinoy) have years of experience with Manhattan restaurants and wanted to bring some of that sophistication to Peekskill’s growing restaurant scene. They have bought four other buildings in the Hudson River town and plan to open a taco and tequila bar, a barbecue place and more.“This is such a great, artsy, open town,” Mr. Steinberger said in a phone conversation after my visits. “We want to bring some new options to the table.”ImageSeared shrimp with guacamole on crispy flour tortillas with Sriracha sauce.Credit...Gregg Vigliotti for The New York TimesThe Hudson Room, which opened in August, is certainly offering new culinary possibilities, and that is a welcome development.",2015-01-03T00:01:28+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/a-review-of-the-hudson-room-in-peekskill.html,645,7
New York Times,"The warning was sent at 4:45 p.m. on New Year’s Eve: A Rikers Island inmate, distraught over an imminent prison sentence, was threatening to harm himself and was possibly suicidal.According to jail policy, correction officers should immediately have put the inmate, Fabian Cruz, on round-the-clock suicide observation. That did not happen. Rather, a full 24 hours after a mental health clinician sounded the alarm, Mr. Cruz was found dead in his cell, lying face up, a bedsheet wrapped around his neck, according to jail employees and internal documents.The death underscores the dysfunction that continues to pervade the Rikers Island jail complex even as New York City officials scramble to fix it amid intense scrutiny by the federal Justice Department, which is now suing the city, charging widespread abuse and neglect of inmates.Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed a series of changes, including added surveillance cameras, more therapeutic programs for inmates and additional training for correction officers, to improve conditions at Rikers. Last year, he allocated $32 million for more guards and improved mental health services.But Mr. Cruz’s death, which was confirmed on Friday by the Correction Department, appears to have resulted from a failure to follow basic policy. The department would not comment on the circumstances surrounding the death.Jail records show that Mr. Cruz, 35, was visited by a mental health clinician at the Robert N. Davoren Center at Rikers on Wednesday afternoon. In a report, the clinician wrote that the inmate had been found to have an adjustment disorder. While he did not appear to be “in acute emotional distress,” the clinician wrote, he had threatened to harm himself.ImageFabian CruzThe clinician immediately sought to have him put on suicide watch and moved to a mental observation unit at a different jail in the complex “as a precautionary measure against acts of self-harm or accidental death,” the report said. Inmates on suicide watch are supposed to be monitored at all times.At least four times when clinicians went to the new unit to give him therapy, he was not there, according to jail records. That was because Mr. Cruz was never moved or put on suicide watch, officials said.A Correction Department employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the death, said a doctor had asked a correction officer to transfer Mr. Cruz to a suicide-watch unit. The officer failed to do so, and on Friday she was put on modified duty and prohibited from working with inmates, the employee said.At 4:24 p.m. on New Year’s Day, a correction officer put out an emergency alert for an inmate who “was not breathing,” jail records say. A doctor, a physician assistant and a nurse arrived six minutes later to find Mr. Cruz on the floor, his head on a pillow, with a sheet tied to the toilet. The officer, the records say, found Mr. Cruz hanging by the sheet, cut him down and started CPR. Mr. Cruz was pronounced dead at 4:50.“Patient most likely committed suicide,” an internal jail report said. “He hanged himself.”About two weeks earlier, Mr. Cruz pleaded guilty to one felony count of attempted first-degree criminal sexual act. According to prosecutors, he repeatedly sexually abused his girlfriend’s daughter over a period of three years, starting when the girl was 14. Under a plea arrangement, he was to be sentenced on Jan. 12 to five years in prison, according to the Staten Island district attorney’s office. In April, he had also been sentenced to two and a half to five years in prison on separate burglary and other charges, but he was kept at Rikers until his death.Mr. Cruz’s hanging comes after several deaths that have drawn attention to abuse of inmates at Rikers, particularly those with mental illness. Last February, a homeless Marine veteran with schizophrenia died when temperatures in his cell soared above 100 degrees. Five months earlier, another inmate with mental illness was found in his cell, naked and covered in feces. He died shortly after. Investigators determined that he had been locked in his cell for seven days without food or medication.Though violence at Rikers Island has been on the rise for years, suicides have been relatively rare. In October, the city announced a three-year, $400,000 initiative to develop new policies for reducing suicide and self-harm by inmates.At the time, the correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, said of suicides, “Far too often inside correctional institutions, violent sentinel events occur that could have been avoided.”",2015-01-03T00:32:54+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/nyregion/rikers-inmate-found-dead-after-threatening-to-harm-himself.html,758,13
New York Times,"Never have I had a holiday-induced ailment that a steaming bowl of pho at Viet Ai in Florham Park could not cure. Every element of this soup is purifying, from the star-anise-scented broth made from beef bones (paleos should love this) to the sprigs of fresh basil served on the side so that you, the diner, may add them, thus minimizing wilt time. Delicate rice noodles swim in the fragrant broth. They amaze me every time I eat them because in this one rendition, they actually taste like rice. A favorite among the 18 kinds of pho, which all share the classic ingredients of rice noodles and meat, is one accompanied by rolls of grilled beef. If you order beef only once in the new year, let it be tonight. In the middle of winter, these delicate rolls taste as if they won first place in a summer grilling competition. The reason? Ai Khanh Do, owner of Viet Ai and its head chef, inserts into each roll a sliver of onion and pork fat. These flavors melt into the meat as it is cooked. ImageThe shrimp salad is dressed up with fresh mint leaves and crushed peanuts.Credit...Matt Rainey for The New York TimesEqually captivating dishes follow. The peanut sauce that accompanies the summer rolls, for example, is neither vinegary nor gloppy. The wonder of it is that except for the garnish (omitted for customers with allergies), it is prepared entirely without peanuts. Sheer alchemy — a mixture of sugar, garlic, oil, hoisin sauce and ground mung beans — produces a sauce as full of peanut flavor as a jar of Skippy. The rolls themselves, rice paper wrapped around cold, bland shrimp, are not sensational, but as a vehicle for the “peanut” sauce they work just fine. My dinner companions, a peanut-butter-loving couple (the husband packs a jar when he travels to Europe) agreed. “I’d love anything with this sauce,” the wife said. My sentiments exactly. Vietnamese food can be as complex as Chinese or Thai, but it is rarely as oily. One example is Viet Ai’s shrimp salad. It has been only a month since my last visit, and already I dream about a return trip when I can eat the entire dish. During my last visit, I had to share it. Fresh mint leaves and crushed peanuts dress up a plate of cooked shrimp with cucumbers, carrots and daikon radishes cut in the shape of French fries. Shrimp salad made with mayonnaise is nice; this one, just the right mix of sweet and sour, is more refreshing. In its oil-free way, it is also more satisfying, especially if you like dishes with texture, which this one has, thanks to the crisp cabbage with which all the other ingredients are mixed.Hotter, in terms of both temperature and seasoning, but equally worth sampling are the chef’s grilled shrimp served on a cloud of steamed rice noodles. Also excellent: Ms. Do’s cubes of juicy flank steak surrounded by curly leaf lettuce, and a bowl of steaming mussels bobbing in a curried coconut broth in which stalks of fragrant lemon grass float. ImageThere are 18 kinds of pho, including one with rolls of grilled beef.Credit...Matt Rainey for The New York TimesLess appealing are some of the more conventional dishes. Biting into the deep-fried Vietnamese-style spring rolls, the first thing you taste is grease. It is not old grease, but neither is it a great introduction to the more interesting appetizers on the menu. The steamed whole flounder was more than one or even two people could finish, but the brown sauce in which it bathed was the rare Viet Ai sauce that lacked flavor. Better entrees are the salmon served in a tangy brew of soy and fish sauce, and the always-fun-to-eat flat noodles known, appropriately, as chow fun. Ms. Do, 60, moved from Vietnam to the United States with her three children in 1988. After working in Vietnamese restaurants in New York, she and a relative opened Viet Ai in 2006. Kenneth Quach, one of Ms. Do’s children and the manager of Viet Ai, told me over the phone after my visits that the restaurant originally attracted a predominantly Asian clientele, but now it serves a more mixed crowd.If there is a downside to dining at Viet Ai, where four people can order twice as much as they can eat for less than $100, it is the décor. It is a work in progress, said Mr. Quach, who foresees additional renovations this year. In the meantime, ignore the dingy rear corridor and limited view (of a shopping center). The dining room, where comfortable booths have replaced metal tables and chairs, is brightly lit, and as welcoming as any in which customers know they are going to be served interesting and expertly prepared food.

New York Times,"Since its opening about three years ago, the Paramount Theater in Huntington has added sparkle to the community. Some of that stardust has drifted to neighboring enterprises like Swallow.Shortly after the tiny restaurant opened in October 2010, I described it as “cozy.” It had about 20 seats and nearly half were at a bar overlooking the open kitchen.ImageAsparagus fries in a tempura coating with a Dijon aioli.Credit...Donna Alberico for The New York TimesPerhaps inspired by the street traffic from the Paramount, the owners of Swallow overhauled the space about a year ago. It closed briefly, and the restaurant reopened last spring.Renovation and expansion don’t adequately describe the complete transformation here. There are now 64 seats in the dining room.Diners enter through the bar, a welcoming space with a long L-shaped wood bar, an exposed brick wall and a large screen showing classic movies. The adjacent dining room is narrow, dark and sleek. It features a long black leather banquette running the length of one wall, wood tables, dark wood floors and metal chairs. Walls are a neutral gray and are dotted with original art including six drawings of musicians ranging from Beethoven to Elvis. Reminders of the old Swallow exist: There are Victorian bird cages throughout the space and, at the back of the dining room, a kitchen bar with six stools facing an open kitchen. The look — elegant but casual — is exemplified in the outfits worn by the wait staff: black pants, white shirts, suspenders and tuxedo ties left untied.The dining style veers toward casual as well. Our server explained that dishes were small plates and that diners should plan to share, as their choices are sent from the kitchen one by one as they are ready.The menu is ever-changing. When we visited, we loved the fried asparagus, about a dozen spears in the crunchiest of tempura coatings, accompanied by an addictive Dijon aioli. Even the asparagus disparagers at my table had to confess that this was an exceptional dish.On another night our favorite dish was also one of the cheapest, deviled eggs (four for $5). They were served liberally spiked with horseradish and were probably the best I’ve ever tasted. (Sorry, mom.)Two stick-to-the-ribs successes were creamy polenta topped with wild mushrooms, chorizo, arugula and Parmesan, and shrimp and grits consisting of three jumbo shrimp atop grits bolstered by andouille sausage and grape tomatoes. Hefty, too, was a plate of grilled skirt steak with potato wedges and caramelized shallots. My favorite dish was four Vietnamese barbecue pork steamed buns. The exquisitely seasoned meat served as a dramatic counterpart to the bland but moist buns. Pickled carrots, cucumber and chilies added lightness and crunch.ImageDeviled eggs.Credit...Donna Alberico for The New York TimesEven lighter options were grilled octopus with a cubed celery-tomato salad, and a classic wedge salad with creamy blue cheese. The pomegranate-onion jam and crisp shallots with the Moroccan spiced lamb chop were memorable but only one tiny chop made sharing hard. There were a few disappointments: a mushy Thai shrimp and crab cake, and a pappardelle dish served with a rather dry veal ragu.Desserts are few but the two we tried got high marks: a warm apple cake with cinnamon crème anglais and a s’mores cake, fudgy and flourless, along with toasted marshmallow cream, shaved chocolate and graham cracker crumbs.With its tasty food, reasonable prices and stunning décor, Swallow has enough star power to compete with its neighbor, or better yet, share an audience.",2015-01-03T00:50:50+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/a-review-of-swallow-in-huntington.html,566,7
New York Times," The Cuban performance artist Tania Bruguera was released from custody on Friday after her third arrest this week related to her efforts to push for freedom of expression. Her #YoTambienExijo (I also demand) support group said she returned to her mother’s house after being released from a police station, though the authorities had not returned her passport. They told Ms. Bruguera, who divides her time between Cuba, New York and France, that she could not leave the country while “resistance and public disorder” charges were pending. Several activists among about 50 government opponents detained Tuesday were also released. The crackdown, condemned by the State Department and 1,000 artists who signed a letter on Friday to President Raúl Castro, was the largest since the diplomatic thaw between the United States and Cuba was announced Dec. 17.

New York Times,"AURORA, Colo. — It was a day out at the spa for Paige Ehresman and her closest friends. Manicures. Hairdos. Makeup. And some gossip — about second grade.The spa industry has begun to target children in a big way, going way beyond mother-daughter manicures. Adult spas are adding separate menus of services for girls, usually ages 4 to 14. In most major cities, there are now dedicated day spas for children, offering a range of massages, facials and other treatments for girls (and sometimes boys) too young to have had their first pimple.“I feel like the best princess in the world,” said Paige, who celebrated her seventh birthday at Sweet and Sassy, a national chain of spas that boasts that its cosmetologists are specially trained to work with children. After the beauty treatments, Paige and her guests walked down a red carpet and disappeared into a hot pink limousine, which took the squealing children on a spin around the parking lot. One 6-year-old guest documented the revelry in a series of selfies.These sanctuaries of luxury proudly pamper their charges, wrapping them in custom-size robes, suggesting oil rubs for heels worn rough by barefoot play, and lifting clients onto massage tables when they are too small to do it themselves. On the high end, the “kids’ treatments” menu at the Beverly Wilshire spa in Beverly Hills, Calif., charges $50 for a 15-minute “princess facial,” which includes “a facial cleanse and massage.” For the mass market, there is the $30 Orbeez Luxury Spa at Toys “R” Us, a toy that looks like a pedicure station in which girls can immerse their feet in tiny gel-filled balls.At the party here in Aurora last month, Paige’s mother, Kari Ehresman, 33, said she was thrilled to be able to treat the girls to a day of playful pampering.“They do deserve something special,” said Ms. Ehresman, who paid about $400 for the party. Paige and her 8-year-old sister, Makayla, had begged for beauty treatments, but Ms. Ehresman had found her own adult spa to be inappropriate for them.“I don’t want them to feel that my saying ‘no’ means that I don’t love them,” she said.The International Spa Association, which tracks industry trends, said that 25 percent of the country’s approximately 20,000 spas now offer services specifically for the under-13 set — up from 15 percent just four years ago. And half of all spas offer services for teenagers, up from a third over the same time period.Some are new businesses focused exclusively on children, while others have expanded into the child market, offering kid-friendly music, banana-scented facials and an age-appropriate vocabulary — customers are “princesses” and toes are “pigglies.”VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/1:37-0:00transcriptA Glamorous Spa Day for Little GirlsThe Seriously Spoiled spa in Dix Hills, N.Y., is one of an increasing number of spas that cater to children. A birthday party celebration includes hairstyling, manicures and pizza.NAThe Seriously Spoiled spa in Dix Hills, N.Y., is one of an increasing number of spas that cater to children. A birthday party celebration includes hairstyling, manicures and pizza.The spa association’s president, Lynne McNees, said it was good for girls to learn that beauty treatments can reduce stress and promote health. “It’s very similar to taking little kids to the dentist,” Ms. McNees said. “Let’s get them early, and get those really good habits.”Most of the child-oriented spas make their money on birthday party packages, billing the events as sophisticated alternatives to a day of pizza and Skee-Ball at the local Chuck E. Cheese. At one New York-area chain, Seriously Spoiled Salon and Spa, parties cost $500 to $3,000, and options include a “bath-bakery” experience, with lotions that smell like edible treats. (Tag line: “Where the main ingredient is you.”)Lisa Gadzinski, 48, and her sister opened Seriously Spoiled on Long Island in 2008. The business, based in Patchogue, N.Y., has not only weathered the recession, but thrived, expanding to two more locations. Several clients are single fathers, lost in the world of girl-care, who bring in their daughters, Ms. Gadzinski said.“Don’t we all want to spoil our children?” she asked.But in the debate over modern parenting, the answer is not always yes.“Oh my God,” said Christine Carter, a sociologist and the author of “Raising Happiness: 10 Simple Steps for More Joyful Kids and Happier Parents.” “What are we coming to? Spas for our children?” She cautioned parents against sending their offspring to places where they are told, “We’re going to treat you like a Kardashian.” Madeline Levine, a child psychologist and author, called the child spa “the worst idea ever.”At Sweet and Sassy in Aurora, though, parents and daughters had plenty of praise for the experience.“I feel reeeeeeeally relaxed,” said Peyton Ruddell, who had just turned 10. She sat on a soft couch with soapy water bubbling at her heels while a cosmetologist, LiShall Michel, 47, clipped her toenails.Peyton’s mother, Love Ruddell, 37, is a mechanic at the Denver Zoo who wears steel-toed boots and gloves to work, but also wears her fingernails long, manicured and painted a saucy red. She said she tried to teach her daughter that “you can be beautiful and tough.”“This is honoring the feminine,” Ms. Ruddell added.Nearby, Ken and Jen Brown raved about the manicure given to their toddler, Faith, 3, as a birthday treat. As Faith scooted her diapered rear out of her seat, Mr. Brown, 41, explained that they had arranged for her to take a ride in the spa’s limousine.And after that?“Well,” he said somewhat sheepishly, “we want to get her potty trained.”",2015-01-03T01:04:46+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/us/after-a-spa-day-looking-years-younger-ok-theyre-only-7.html,873,1
New York Times,"John W. Hinckley Jr., who shot and wounded President Ronald Reagan and three others in 1981, will not face charges in the death last summer of James S. Brady, the former White House press secretary, federal prosecutors said Friday.The Virginia authorities ruled that Mr. Brady’s death in August was a homicide, putting Mr. Hinckley’s legal fate into question while prosecutors considered whether to charge him with murder. Mr. Brady was paralyzed in the shooting outside a Washington hotel.In a statement on Friday, the office of the United States attorney for the District of Columbia said that principles of criminal law would keep federal prosecutors from pursuing charges against Mr. Hinckley, now 59, who has been largely confined to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington since he was found not guilty by reason of insanity at his trial in 1982.“The decision was made following a review of applicable law, the history of the case and the circumstances of Mr. Brady’s death, including recently finalized autopsy findings,” the office said.Virginia officials, the prosecutors said, found that Mr. Brady’s death was caused by a “gunshot wound of head and consequences thereof.” Among the conditions linked to the wound and the resulting brain injury, officials said, was aspiration pneumonia.In opting against charges, prosecutors relied in part on the legal doctrine of collateral estoppel, which would have prohibited jurors from concluding — or the authorities from even arguing — that Mr. Hinckley was mentally competent when he opened fire. “Hinckley would be entitled to a directed verdict that he was not guilty of the murder of Mr. Brady by reason of insanity,” the United States attorney’s office wrote.Prosecutors also cited a rule that, at the time of Mr. Hinckley’s trial, limited the time frame in which homicide cases could be pursued.Mr. Hinckley’s lawyer, Barry W. Levine, said there was “nothing about that decision that is surprising” and that any other conclusion would have been “a political splash.”“This prosecution, if brought, would be immediately dismissed,” Mr. Levine said. “It is barred as a matter of law and a matter of fact.”In a written statement, Mr. Brady’s family said it “respects the decision.”“We deeply appreciate the extraordinary outpouring of love and support since the Bear’s passing,” the family said, using a nickname for Mr. Brady. “We miss him greatly.”Although Mr. Hinckley’s trial ended decades ago, his case has periodically returned to the courts.In December 2013, a federal judge again expanded the scope of unsupervised visits Mr. Hinckley could make to Williamsburg, Va., where his mother lives. Although the judge, Paul L. Friedman of Federal District Court in Washington, allowed Mr. Hinckley certain liberties, his decision included distinct reminders of Mr. Hinckley’s past, including that he could not travel “to areas where the president or members of Congress may be visiting.”Mr. Levine said on Friday that Mr. Hinckley had, in the years after the shooting, developed an understanding of what happened at a time when he was “ravaged by mental disease” and, in addition to shooting Mr. Reagan and Mr. Brady, wounded a Secret Service agent and a police officer.“He’s haunted by what it is that he did when he was not well, and getting well carries with it a real burden,” Mr. Levine said. “You begin to understand the consequences of your acts. At the time, he didn’t really appreciate all of that.”",2015-01-03T01:16:48+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/us/attempted-reagan-assassin-wont-face-charges-in-james-bradys-death.html,569,10
New York Times,"“Good afternoon. Doctor speaking.”Dr. Moshe B. Mirilashvili took call after call that afternoon, answering the phone from a small examination room beneath posters of the skeletal system and the knee joint.“Yes, we are still open,” he told one caller, as if any alternative were unthinkable, when, in fact, the news that he was in the office was sweeping the block of startled neighbors. “What time do you want to come in?”It was Dec. 16. Five days earlier, teams of police officers and federal agents had raided Dr. Mirilashvili’s office, on West 162nd Street in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. The door to the office was plain and unmarked, but that had never stopped a staggering number of patients from finding the place.The officers took practically everything but the anatomy posters: computers, hard drives, paper files, surveillance camera archives. They arrested an office manager. A separate team of agents arrived at Dr. Mirilashvili’s home on Long Island and arrested him, leading the 66-year-old man out in handcuffs.Dr. Mirilashvili was accused of running a pill mill out of his clinic, writing prescriptions for oxycodone that were not medically necessary. He wrote 13,000 prescriptions in two years, according to an indictment brought in the Southern District of New York that was unsealed at his arrest. In one day alone, he wrote 46 prescriptions, the indictment stated, and in all, he collected $2.6 million in cash payments, $200 at a time, from patients.The case was born not out of informers from the drug world or alarms going off in the pharmacies filling the prescriptions. It began from complaints by neighbors about all the new traffic on the block. Cars were double-parked, patients were standing around outside, not looking as if they were in pain. The doctor was robbed at gunpoint, twice. Once, the police came after a knife fight.Dr. Mirilashvili was one of three doctors writing bad prescriptions in a sprawling drug ring, according to the indictment. The other two doctors worked elsewhere in Manhattan and in the Bronx.They are said to have created fake examination results describing injury or pain and sold prescriptions to so-called patients, who reported to people the indictment called “crew chiefs.” According to the authorities, a police informer posed as a patient last January and acknowledged to Dr. Mirilashvili that he was experiencing no pain, but after handing the doctor $200, the informer left with a prescription for oxycodone.The patients filled the prescriptions and turned them over to the chiefs, who resold the pills. One of those arrested, Ray Williams, 55, of the Bronx, was a chief who handled around 30 patients, the indictment stated.Things got so crowded outside the clinic that in November, the doctor hired security guards from a Manhattan firm, Carlo Security and Transportation Services, said the firm’s owner, Angel Carlo, a retired New York City police lieutenant. The firm sent over two armed guards, one per day, both retired Department of Correction officers. They were there for a couple of weeks and noticed nothing illegal, Mr. Carlo said.Then came the raid and the arrest and, as one neighbor described it this week, the “hoopla.” So it came as some surprise, five days later, to be greeted by Dr. Mirilashvili, wearing a white lab coat and bidding a visitor to sit in the exam room.“What they have to do, they are doing,” he said of the arrest. He then launched into a lengthy and detailed primer on pain management (“The spinal cord is a huge trunk”) before denying any wrongdoing.“They call me kingpin or something like this,” the doctor said in an accent he brought with him in the 1970s from his homeland, the Republic of Georgia. “Maybe I’m Scarface. They can call me anything.”He said he believed he had been targeted because of the clientele he attracted to a block of Manhattan that had become more and more affluent. He serves the poor, he said, laborers who have injured themselves on the job.“I accept well-dressed patients and not-well-dressed patients,” he said. “Patients who smell like perfume and patients who smell like sweat.”Dr. Mirilashvili said he was open for business, but he was forbidden, as part of his bail arrangement, to prescribe opiates. On that Tuesday afternoon, he did not immediately share that news with patients who called or visited. To one man pulling on the locked front door, Dr. Mirilashvili shouted through the window, “Come back at 2!”Now, the prescription pad is gone, and with it, the doctor. He disappeared this week. A neighbor, requesting anonymity for safety reasons, said the building superintendent told him the doctor had turned over his keys. Reached Wednesday at home, Dr. Mirilashvili said, “I have nothing to say.”",2015-01-03T01:20:02+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/nyregion/a-doctor-who-denies-hes-a-kingpin.html,797,13
New York Times,"ADMA, Lebanon — As the clock ticked toward midnight on New Year’s Eve, Leila Abdel Latif, a Lebanese fortuneteller, sat under the glaring lights of a television studio here and unveiled to viewers across the Arab world what 2015 held in store. Wearing a black pantsuit and a diamond necklace, Ms. Abdel Latif peered through reading glasses and read from a stack of cards two inches thick, stating her predictions one by one.Chaos would rock Beirut. Bloodshed would roil Iraq. Blacks and whites would clash in the United States. A band would win international fame for reviving the hits of Michael Jackson.Such predictions have put Ms. Abdel Latif among the most prominent of the self-declared soothsayers who appear on competing Lebanese television channels in what has become a widely watched New Year’s Eve tradition in the Arab world.In a region where religious extremism is on the rise and many governments criminalize divination, Lebanon stands apart for giving its fortunetellers a prominent role.Besides entertaining, they often give private consultations to powerful officials. Ms. Abdel Latif says her clients have included ministers, members of Parliament, kings and presidents, although she refuses to discuss names.During an interview, Ms. Abdel Latif, a short, chatty, 55-year-old mother of two, was dismissive of other divination efforts.“I don’t believe in horoscopes, tarot, coffee cups or palm reading,” she said. “Every person has the sixth sense, but some people are stronger than others.”ImageMs. Abdel Latif’s notecards and glasses. The New Year’s Eve show is her biggest of the year and is widely watched throughout the Middle East.Credit...Andrew McConnell for The New York TimesEven though divination is deemed a sin in Islam, Ms. Abdel Latif calls herself a devout Muslim and considers her revelations a gift.“God gives the blessings of wealth, intelligence and health,” she said. “This is the blessing of vision.”Ms. Abdel Latif’s holiday show is the yearly highlight of her monthly program, “History Sees,” on Lebanon’s LBC network. The show kicked off this year with a slick mash-up of cherry-picked predictions from recent years followed by news clips appearing to show them coming true.In the video, Ms. Abdel Latif said that Lebanon’s parliamentary elections would be delayed, as indeed they were. She said that Prime Minister Najib Mikati would leave power, as indeed he did. And she predicted an important role for Tammam Salam, now the prime minister.Then two hosts in tuxedos peppered her with questions and she responded by reading her cards. While most queries focused on Lebanon, her predictions spanned the globe.She told of terrorist attacks in the United States and fear in Europe. She foresaw improved relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. She said the Syrian government and the opposition would begin negotiations to end the civil war, but that President Bashar al-Assad would remain in power.As is often the case, many of her predictions were so general they could apply to a range of events. She warned that Beirut would “shake” three times in the coming months, once because of “a crime or an important tragic event.” Other predictions are safe bets, like continued bloodshed in Iraq and attacks in Gaza.Ms. Abdel Latif sometimes predicts moves that are made soon after by Lebanese politicians, raising suspicions among many Lebanese that officials tip her off to give their actions an air of destiny.While she denies accepting payment from officials, her fame clearly gets her perks. During the show, she thanked both a Lebanese jeweler for her necklace and the high-end designer who made her outfit, predicting he would win international prizes. She also thanked a Lebanese businessman who, for no clear reason, gave her a Jeep.Lina Khatib, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said that a combination of Lebanon’s relative social openness and the uncertainty of life there has helped make it the capital of fortunetelling in a region where many countries jail accused sorcerers and Saudi Arabia sometimes beheads them.“The Lebanese live in a country where the political situation is unpredictable and where the future of the country itself is uncertain,” she said. “When people don’t have faith in the safety net of social institutions, they turn to these clairvoyants to find out what happens next.”Ms. Abdel Latif says her abilities surfaced early, giving her childhood a Harry Potter-like drama. At age 12, she said, she foresaw the death of her grandfather. At 14, she visualized her mother crying because something had happened to her new husband, who died soon after, she said. At 18, she became engaged to a university professor, but felt she would not spend her life with him. He, too, soon died, she said.She made her first television appearance 20 years ago and her fame has grown since. Now, Ms. Abdel Latif says that she has been on every Lebanese station except Al Manar, which belongs to Hezbollah. She gives private consultations for $200 an hour, more than many Lebanese doctors charge.Her record is mixed. She claims to have foreseen the Sept. 11 attacks, although there is no evidence that she did.She once predicted “people wearing black at the Hariri palace.” Soon after, Rafik Hariri, then the prime minister, was killed in a car bombing.Her predictions from last year’s New Year’s show are also a mixed bag. She said that a female artist would fall sick and maybe not recover. So when Sabah, an 87-year-old Lebanese diva, died in November, some said Ms. Abdel Latif had called it.But she also predicted that Abdel Fattah el-Sisi would not become president of Egypt, which he did in June.When asked about predictions that failed to pan out, Ms. Abdel Latif often says they need more time and compares herself to Nostradamus, the storied French seer who is credited by some with predicting world events centuries in advance.While maintaining that her success rate is between 75 and 90 percent, she admitted that she sometimes misses.“We are all human in the end,” she said.",2015-01-03T01:34:46+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/middleeast/when-celebrity-fortunetellers-talk-the-lebanese-listen.html,977,4
New York Times,"Gamely traversing his native Woodstock on a rainy weekday recently, the guitarist Jim Weider pointed out its onetime cultural hot spots, ending at Levon Helm Studios, which stands as a wooden shrine to its creator, the co-founder of the Band and a latter-day link to Woodstock’s post-festival heyday.The studios’ bookings have dropped off since Mr. Helm died in April 2012, shaking the tight-knit Woodstock community. But Mr. Weider, who collaborated with Mr. Helm for 25 years, 15 of them as a member of the Band, and other surviving members of the Helm inner circle have formed the Weight, an ensemble dedicated to playing the Band’s songs — and keeping the spirit alive.“We want to try and keep the tradition going,” he said.As word about the Weight’s formation has spread, the demand for tickets has been strong. The group’s last date, a rousing late-December performance at the Helm studios, was, like most of the 20 or so concerts the Weight has put on, sold out. On Jan. 8, the group will appear at City Winery in Manhattan, which has added a second show to meet the demand. The band will also appear at Daryl’s House in Pawling, N.Y., on Feb. 20.The performances have inspired dancing in the aisles, reflecting the continued appeal of favorites like “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” “Up on Cripple Creek” and “The Weight,” songs Mr. Weider cited as “anchors” of the show. “The Weight” — whose laid-back call to “take a load off Fanny” helped define the Woodstock ethos — has, Mr. Weider said, emerged as the band’s de facto anthem.ImageMr. WeiderCredit...Suzy Allman for The New York TimesThe response to the effort owes in part to the authority conferred on it by the band’s lineage. All of the Weight’s members — Mr. Weider, Randy Ciarlante on drums, Byron Isaacs on bass, and Brian Mitchell and Marty Grebb on keyboards — played with Mr. Helm or the other founding members of the Band whom they survive, the keyboardist Richard Manuel and the bassist Rick Danko, who died in 1986 and 1999, respectively. The Weight thus lays claim to the Band’s legacy.That claim is bolstered by the group’s treatment of the material: rough-hewed and hard-charging in the manner of the original, with Mr. Weider, 63, leading the charge. A plain-spoken graduate of Onteora High School who still plays the Fender Telecaster he bought for $340 in 1971, Mr. Weider met Mr. Helm when the guitarist was a teenager working as a clerk in a Woodstock record store in the late 1960s. The attraction was immediate and lifelong.“Levon loved Jimmy like a little brother,” said Barbara O’Brien, the longtime general manager of the Helm studios and a Woodstock native. Mr. Weider said the brotherly feeling was mutual.The two musicians’ working relationship began in the late ’70s, when Mr. Weider, having returned to Woodstock after building a reputation in Nashville and Atlanta, joined the Levon Helm All Stars. The relationship grew and, in 1985, Mr. Helm asked him to join the Band, which had been reconstituted after its breakup following the departure of the guitarist Robbie Robertson.If the history at this point seems a distant echo, that is no surprise. As Mr. Weider pointed out, sounds have been muted at so many of the music spots that once hummed with activity. The Joyous Lake, an unassuming room where the jazz bassist Charles Mingus once traded stage time with rock ‘n’ roll stars appearing under pseudonyms, had become a clothing store. The Sled Hill Café, where Mr. Weider schmoozed with the guitarists Buzz Feiten and Tim Hardin, had been reduced to a plot of grass, while a grassy plot that served as the site for so-called sound-outs, small gatherings that presaged the 1969 Woodstock festival, had given way to suburban-style housing.ImageTape from Mr. Helm’s mixer board.Credit...Suzy Allman for The New York TimesMost telling, perhaps, the Bearsville Studios, once fashioned by the manager Albert Grossman as the Band’s recording headquarters, appeared to have become a dumping ground. Standing in the driving rain at the top of a long and winding Speare Road just west of Woodstock proper, Mr. Weider, who had not seen the building for nearly a decade, peered at it in obvious dismay.“It’s a shame,” he said.Back at the Helm studios, printed set lists from a past performance lay untouched on the bandstand. The studios’ rooms, 5,000 square feet of space in all, lay silent, save for the conversation of Mr. Weider, Ms. O’Brien and Mr. Ciarlante, and the rain hitting the roof of the wooden structure. Little work had been done to the physical structure, inside or out, since Mr. Helm’s death, Ms. O’Brien said. But without Mr. Helm as a drawing card, the atmosphere had changed, with the demand for the space weakening, though to her he remained a white-hot presence — and she intended to keep the flame alive.“He never gave up,” she said, “and we don’t want to give up.”Mr. Ciarlante echoed the sentiment. A native of nearby Saugerties who, on Mr. Weider’s recommendation, became a member of the Band in 1991, he recalled the raucous weekly Midnight Ramble concerts and the buoyant after-hours recording sessions — “We did a lot of laughing,” he said.

New York Times,"The man placed a hand on the paper as gently as a doctor feeling for a pulse. With his other hand he dipped a bamboo brush into a bowl of ink, turning the thirsty bristles black, then brought its tip to the paper’s surface. The bristles whispered, leaving their trace. “It’s important that this be done right,” said the man, Zhao Ru. In the complex choreography of Chinese funerals, an important element is the funeral scroll, made from cloth or paper and adorned with messages rendered in calligraphy to express condolences or to praise the life of the deceased. Mr. Zhao, 73, a Chinese calligrapher who lives in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, has been making ceremonial scrolls for much of his life. On Friday, he undertook one of his most high-profile jobs, creating a pair of scrolls for the wake and funeral of Wenjian Liu, one of the two police officers killed last month by a gunman in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The wake is scheduled for Saturday and the funeral for Sunday, both at the Aievoli Funeral Home in southern Brooklyn. ImageZhao Ru, a calligrapher, at work on a memorial scroll for Officer Wenjian Liu, who was killed last month in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York TimesIn his home city of Toishan, in southern China, Mr. Zhao was a schoolteacher and well-known calligrapher. He immigrated to the United States in 1989 with several family members, and he worked in Chinese restaurants and garment factories in New York.But his fame as a calligrapher had migrated with him, and over the years he has frequently been commissioned to provide calligraphy for funerals and other occasions. In the case of Officer Liu’s funeral, Mr. Zhao said, he was acting on his own accord and was not getting paid: He had been planning to do the scrolls since hearing of the officers’ murders. “I could use my calligraphy to memorialize the officer,” he said in Mandarin. “What a pity it is. He was such a good police officer. He was an only son.” Late Friday morning, he put on a dark winter coat and a black, flat cap and left his house in Bensonhurst to gather supplies. He carried a satchel holding his brushes and rough drafts of the scrolls. ImageMr. Zhao, left, examined paper for funeral scrolls with a store clerk, Jerry Lin. Mr. Zhao volunteered to create them for the Liu family.Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York Times“It’s a lot like making food in a Chinese restaurant,” he said. “There’s a lot of preparation, but it only takes a couple of minutes to stir fry.”On a predominantly Chinese stretch of Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, he stopped at Xinhua Bookshop and Stationery Supply. A shop clerk, Jerry Lin, brought out three different Chinese-made inks and then pointed to each in turn: “This is like the iPhone 1. This is like iPhone 2. This is like iPhone 6.” Mr. Zhao went for the most expensive. But he balked when the clerk said that the calligraphy paper was available only in reams of 100; he was looking for only 10 pieces. “This is for Wenjian Liu,” Mr. Zhao clarified.Mr. Lin’s eyes widened. “Oh, why didn’t you say so?” he exclaimed. “This is on the house!” ImageA funeral home employee hangs calligraphy before Officer Liu's wake.Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York TimesAfter a stop for a coffee and a piece of bread at a coffee shop, Mr. Zhao dropped by a Chinese restaurant, the same one where Officer Liu held his wedding reception several months ago. There he saw Dick Chin Lee, a feng shui master from the same part of Toishan as Mr. Zhao. The men greeted each other warmly and Mr. Lee extolled Mr. Zhao’s reputation as a calligrapher. “We’re so honored that he’s here for us,” Mr. Lee said.The last stop was the funeral home. Peter Xiong, a Chinese assistant to the funeral home director, cleared room for Mr. Zhao on a wooden table. The building was abuzz with preparations, with staff vacuuming and polishing, and it smelled of lemon-scented cleaner. Mr. Zhao laid out a large piece of paper and taped it to the table. He considered it for a moment. Unsatisfied, he untaped the paper, slipped sheets of newspaper under it and taped it down again. Once again, he considered the arrangement and repositioned it. This fidgeting went on for about 15 minutes. Finally, about 4 p.m., he was ready to write.Nearly three hours later, after several delays and abandoned drafts, he finally completed the pieces. The two scrolls, each with seven Chinese characters, said, “In the sphere of law enforcement his vision is left unrealized,” and, “For his service to the people, his name will forever be cherished in our hearts.” He created an additional sign, with four Chinese characters, saying, “A model for all police.” Stepping back from the table, he apologized for taking so long and said that the fallen officer’s “spirit had moved me to conjure this work.”Mr. Xiong climbed a ladder in a room where part of the ceremonies will unfold, and stapled the four-character sign to the wall and the two scrolls on either side. “I very rarely see a calligrapher who makes characters of this quality,” he said, adding that they suitably honored the life of Officer Liu. “Without this, the room would lack the high quality of the life that he led.”",2015-01-03T01:46:09+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/nyregion/a-calligrapher-brings-an-elegant-touch-to-an-officers-funeral.html,834,13
New York Times,"BOSTON — The house on the rise has long been a symbol of Catholicism in Boston. When it was built, its grandeur demonstrated the wherewithal of the city’s newly powerful Roman Catholic community. When it was sold, the transaction reflected the straits of a once-powerful archdiocese brought low by scandal.Now, the bedrooms of the Italianate palazzo where all of Boston’s 20th-century cardinals, as well as a visiting Pope John Paul II, once slept have been gutted, in preparation for it to be remade as a museum.The conversion of the cardinals’ residence is the final step in the transformation of a leafy expanse on the western edge of Boston that was once so packed with Catholic institutions — a seminary, a college, the residence and the archdiocesan headquarters — that it was referred to as Little Rome. It is still Catholic — most of the land is owned by Boston College, a Jesuit institution, and there are crosses and a statue of St. Ignatius on the campus. But the seminary gymnasium is now a dance studio; the old tribunal, where marriages were annulled, houses a center on aging; and the former chancery is the college’s alumni center.A decade after the Archdiocese of Boston began the process of selling property at its headquarters to Boston College to pay victims of sexual abuse by clergy members, the most visible vestiges of the land’s historical uses are an archdiocesan seminary, now in half the building it once filled, and a grave site for the cardinal who acquired much of the land but whose remains were disinterred and relocated as a condition of the real estate deal.ImageMembers of the Boston College Irish Dance Club at their new dance studio, formerly the seminary’s gym.Credit...Jared Wickerham for The New York Times“This property was a visible symbol of the imperial archdiocese in the early 20th century, and then, during the very difficult years in 2002 and 2003, it was a site of daily protest and picketing,” said David Quigley, a historian and the provost of Boston College. “The talented young people buzzing around the campus are the most hopeful sign that there’s something distinctly Jesuit and Catholic playing out there today, but not necessarily something that earlier leaders would have recognized.”The transformation of the 65 acres, which Boston College purchased for $172 million and refurbished for another $100 million, in many ways prefigured changes in the wider church.Even before the Archdiocese of Boston sold the land, the archbishop of Boston, Sean P. O’Malley, who as a Capuchin Franciscan friar had taken a vow of poverty, announced that he was not interested in living in the mansion of his predecessors, and moved into a modest cathedral rectory. That step has since been mirrored by Pope Francis, who lives in a Vatican guesthouse rather than the apostolic palace, and by several American prelates, including the new archbishop of Chicago, Blase J. Cupich, who have chosen more humble residences than those of their predecessors.The Archdiocese of Boston sold its headquarters for the practical purpose of settling sexual abuse cases, but the move that resulted — to a modern office building in a suburban industrial park that was donated to the archdiocese — also reflected demographic changes, as American Catholic dioceses have become smaller and more suburban.The uses of the land echo changes in the church: In particular, Boston College has set up a new School of Theology and Ministry there, which combines the training of Jesuits — newly energized by the popularity of Francis, the first Jesuit pope — with a strong emphasis on training lay people. There is a new residence for 70 Jesuit priests on the property. Still to come, the college hopes, are residences for undergraduates, as well as baseball and softball fields, parking and, possibly, more fine arts programs near the new museum.ImageThe cardinal’s home in Brighton, the last building to be renovated.Credit...Katherine Taylor for The New York TimesThe Brighton section of Boston, where the acreage is, began its history as a Catholic stronghold in 1880, when Archbishop John J. Williams acquired land there for a new seminary, St. John’s, which opened four years later. Boston College, then in the city’s South End, moved to land across Commonwealth Avenue from the seminary property in 1913. And Archbishop William H. O’Connell, who later became the city’s first cardinal, moved the archdiocesan offices to a site between the seminary and the college there in the 1920s, building himself the grand home with money bequeathed from the fortune of B. F. Keith, a vaudeville theater magnate.“Cardinal O’Connell was always eager to make statements about Catholic success in front of the Boston Brahmins — the Yankees — statements about Catholics having arrived after a long period of being the immigrants, the poor, the looked-down-on,” said James M. O’Toole, a Boston College history professor. “His big phrase, when he became archbishop, was ‘the Puritan has passed; the Catholic remains,’ and he was making a visible statement by building a big house in more leafy surroundings.”Cardinal O’Connell also built himself a stone mausoleum, and said in his will that he desired to be interred there after he died in 1944. But Boston College — his alma mater — did not want the responsibility of taking care of his remains. In 2011, the mausoleum was quietly dismantled and the cardinal’s body relocated to a nearby seminary courtyard. Some observers saw irony in the move: A century earlier, when Cardinal O’Connell first took over management of the seminary, he ousted the Sulpician priests who were running it at the time, and demanded they exhume and take with them the remains of their own deceased colleagues.The house had its own colorful history. When Cardinal Bernard F. Law lived there, there was a silver tray kept in the foyer, and his red biretta was placed atop the tray, or removed from it, to signal whether or not he was in the building. A group of nuns lived in the building to take care of the cardinal and the house; there was also a chapel, from which daily Mass was broadcast, and a conference room in which the table featured a plaque saying that John Paul II sat there, and the walls featured portraits of all of the diocese’s past bishops. In the basement was a swimming pool, long boarded over.During the height of Cardinal Law’s power, the house was the site of an annual garden party, to raise money for Catholic Charities, that was considered a must for the city’s power brokers, most of whom were Catholic. But as the sexual abuse crisis exploded in 2002, the house became the backdrop for protests, and in December of that year, at Creagh Library on the archdiocesan campus, Cardinal Law announced his resignation.“Originally that land was a seminary, and a seminary is to be a seedbed of priests,” said the Rev. William P. Leahy, the president of Boston College. “In some ways, it still is a seedbed, but it’s lay men and women, priests and students. It’s still a great incubator for the future of the church.”",2015-01-03T01:48:03+0000,U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/us/seat-of-bostons-catholic-power-gives-way-to-other-pursuits.html,1152,10
New York Times,"ESKILSTUNA, Sweden — As Khalif Samantar knelt for afternoon prayers at the Eskilstuna Islamic Dawa Center on Christmas Day, he sensed a growing heat and a low, rushing sound coming from a nearby hallway. He focused his mind on the ritual, only to realize seconds later that someone was shouting, “The mosque is on fire!”Mr. Samantar sprang through an open window and rushed through the snow in his stocking feet for help. Though about 70 people were inside the mosque at the time, no one was injured. The fire, which gutted the Dawa center, was the worst of three suspected arson attacks on mosques in Sweden over the last 10 days. In the same period, two freighters bearing hundreds of asylum seekers were abandoned by their crews off the coast of Italy, adding to a surge of more than 200,000 migrants to Europe in 2014.“We left our country as refugees. We were not looking for food or benefits, we were looking for somewhere to feel safe,” said Abdirahman Farah Warsame, the imam at the mosque where the fire occurred on Christmas Day. He is originally from Somalia. “Now that is gone. We have a feeling that society is turning against us.”Indeed, the relentless stream of migrants to Europe — propelled by the war in Syria and turmoil across the Middle East and the Horn of Africa — has combined with economic troubles and rising fear of Islamic radicalism to fuel a backlash against immigrants, directed most viciously at Muslims.The simmering resentments and suspicions have driven debates across Europe about tighter controls on immigration. Worries about immigration have helped buoy right-wing parties in Britain, Denmark, France and Hungary. German officials recorded more than 70 attacks against mosques from 2012 to 2014, including an arson, and the police in Britain have recorded an increase in hate crimes against Muslims. There are few places where the turn against immigrants is more surprising than Sweden, where a solid core of citizens still supports the 65-year-old open door policy toward immigrants facing hardship that has long earned international respect for the country.ImageWorshipers in Eskilstuna, Sweden,  held services in a high school gym after a fire gutted their mosque on Christmas Day.Credit...Alexander Mahmoud for The New York TimesOn Friday, hundreds of Swedes gathered outside the royal palace in Stockholm and in other cities to show solidarity with the Muslim population a day after an unknown assailant threw a bottle filled with flammable liquid at a mosque in the northern city of Uppsala and sprayed racist slogans on the building. The firebomb caused no injuries and did not damage the building. But as each day brings more reports of immigrants who have boarded ships and sneaked across European borders, the famous tolerance of the Swedes is being tested as never before.Despite a lackluster economy, Sweden was third behind only Germany and France in the number of people registering for asylum in 2012, according to the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. Relative to its population, Sweden received the second-highest share of asylum applications in the European Union after Malta, the institute says.The Syrian conflict has boosted the number of asylum seekers. Of 81,000 people seeking asylum in Sweden in 2014, roughly half were from Syria, the Swedish Migration Board said.Opposition to the rising numbers is growing. The far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats had their best showing ever — nearly 13 percent of votes — in elections in September.The entry of the Sweden Democrats to parliament in 2010 had already opened the door for a previously unthinkable discussion about turning back the country’s policy of taking in foreigners on humanitarian grounds and granting them access to the country’s generous welfare system.ImageKhalif Samantar, right, an immigrant from Somalia, jumped out a window to escape from a burning mosque in Eskilstuna, Sweden, on Christmas Day.Credit...Alexander Mahmoud for The New York TimesAdrian Groglopo, a professor of social science at the University of Gothenburg, has studied discrimination in Sweden over the past decade. He said that Sweden has long been a racially segregated country where many immigrants live in ghettos and struggle to find jobs, but that the success of the Sweden Democrats has made racism more socially acceptable. “It is a very difficult time in Sweden,” Dr. Groglopo said. “Now we can talk about things that we weren’t allowed to talk about before. It is a kind of coup d’état.”Last month, the Sweden Democrats threatened to bring down Prime Minister Stefan Lofven’s minority government. Early elections were averted only through a last-minute deal that observers say granted the anti-immigrant party even more power by pulling it from the sidelines and making it the primary opposition.The party’s growth has occurred despite the fact that roughly a fifth of Sweden’s 9.6 million people were born abroad or to immigrant parents in Sweden. Most immigrants here have access to education, but government figures show a disproportionate unemployment rate for them, more than twice the national rate of about 8 percent. The disparity helped fuel riots in immigrant neighborhoods outside Stockholm in 2013.In Germany, another anti-immigrant movement is underway. In recent weeks, a group calling itself the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West has attracted as many as 17,500 people to rallies that demand stifling of immigration. The group has called for more rallies on Monday, in Dresden and Cologne. Omar Mustafa, president of the Islamic Association of Sweden, which represents about 40 communities across the country, said the recent fires at mosques were the culmination of a year of rising anti-Islamic attacks, from women having their hijabs, or head coverings, pulled off in the streets to the vandalism of 14 mosques, as well as racist or anti-Muslim vitriol spread through social media.“It is a scary development in Swedish society,” Mr. Mustafa said by telephone. “It is a big movement that is moving from the Internet to the real world.”Vandals broke windows in the mosque in Eskilstuna twice last year and twice in 2013. But Mr. Warsame, the imam, said the mosque — located in a ground-floor storefront in a residential area of largely immigrants — had good relationships with its neighbors and the city officials.When people nearby complained about the disturbance of comings and goings for late-night prayers during Ramadan, Mr. Warsame and the leaders of two other mosques with similar problems sought out a remote location for their holiday ritual.No arrests have been made in the Christmas Day blaze that gutted the mosque in Eskilstuna, or the Dec. 29 fire at a mosque in Eskov or the attack in Uppsala. In response, the national police have tightened security at mosques and other religious buildings across the country.The fire in Eskilstuna prompted an outpouring of support for the congregation, including an event in which dozens of people pasted handmade, heart-shaped notes to the boarded-up windows of the mosque in what they called a “love bomb.” The event was organized by an activist group known as Tillsammans for Eskilstuna, or Together for Eskilstuna. Despite the support, members of the mosque said they remained rattled.Mr. Samantar, who is originally from Somalia, said he struggles to get through his prayers without smelling smoke or hearing the rush of a fire. After he escaped that day, he said, he feared that women and children were trapped in other rooms of the burning building, and anxiety haunts him still, even in his sleep.“We would always take our families with us to the mosque,” said Mr. Samantar, a father of three. “The mosque was always our safe place. It’s not anymore.”",2015-01-03T01:51:39+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/in-sweden-the-land-of-the-open-door-anti-muslim-sentiment-finds-a-foothold.html,1213,4
New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — For the first time since colonial powers carved Syria and Lebanon into separate countries, Syrians will soon need visas to enter Lebanon, the latest and most significant in a series of new measures by Syria’s neighbors to try to control an overwhelming flow of refugees that appears unlikely to end any time soon.More than three million Syrians have fled their country during nearly four years of war — with more than 1.1 million seeking refuge in Lebanon alone — creating an enduring humanitarian, economic and political crisis that has put extraordinary pressure on Syria’s neighbors, especially Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.With no political settlement in sight that would allow the bulk of the refugees to return home, neighboring countries are recasting their policies to recognize the long-term nature of the challenge. Turkey has moved to better integrate the more than one million Syrians it is hosting, granting access to education and social services. But Lebanon and Jordan are moving in the opposite direction, making it harder for Syrians to enter, and more difficult for them to work and receive services once they arrive.Lebanon’s announcement, which was a New Year’s Eve surprise to Syrians preparing to bid good riddance to a year that was perhaps the deadliest in the war, comes at a time when the United Nations says there are more refugees worldwide than at any time since World War II. The wave of people fleeing war, oppression and extreme poverty has overwhelmed regional governments and prompted humanitarian organizations to press wealthier nations to take in larger numbers of refugees.“Across the region, there are various measures being taken by host governments that are restrictive on refugees,” said Ron Redmond, a senior spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. “We understand the reasons they cite for doing this, but at the same time our job is to ensure the refugees aren’t pushed back to someplace where they may be in danger.”In Lebanon, a country of just four million citizens, in addition to the 1.1 million refugees registered with the United Nations there are an estimated 500,000 who are unregistered. (More than seven million have been internally displaced in Syria.) The visa requirement is scheduled to begin Monday, according to rules published by country’s General Security Agency, which handles border controls and residency permits.The new rule is a stark symbol of new divisions in the region, given the deep historical ties between the two countries. But it is also an indication of the weakened position of Syria, a country that long influenced Lebanon, sending in troops during its smaller neighbor’s civil war in 1976 and going on to politically dominate the country, maintaining tens of thousands of troops there until 2005. Syria still requires no visa for Lebanese citizens, a vestige of what was once a no-visa regimen among the Arab countries. Some of those countries have erected new entry barriers for one another’s citizens in recent years as conflict has spread, introducing new economic, sectarian and political strains.The measure will have an immediate impact on Syrians, for whom Lebanon is the most popular escape route. Not counting border procedures, Beirut is just a two-hour drive from Damascus, along a route still controlled by the government and relatively secure.In recent months, Lebanon has turned back a growing number of Syrians at the border, on a relatively ad hoc basis, but refugees have still trickled through. Some Syrians cross illegally along porous borders in the mountains, but a large majority of refugees have entered at official crossing points, the United Nations says.ImageA Syrian child collected water at another unofficial camp. Officials in Lebanon say that the refugees are straining resources in the country and that the visa requirement will begin Monday.Credit...Anwar Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. Redmond said the United Nations refugee agency was studying the measure to learn whether it affected the one million officially registered refugees already in the country. But he added that a gradual tightening of entry requirements had already had a marked effect.The number of officially registered arrivals in Lebanon in November was down 75 percent from the summer, suggesting that many people were either turned away or did not try to cross because they had heard of the new restrictions.“We don’t know where they are going,” Mr. Redmond said. “But there have certainly got to be a lot of desperate people.”The visa announcement caused immediate consternation among those not registered. Some are middle-class professionals who do not consider themselves in need of refugee benefits and have relied on what up to now was an automatically granted six-month residency permit that could be renewed. Others arrived illegally and have not registered because they fear the authorities. Still others are Syrians who travel between the two countries on regular family and work business. Long before the war, hundreds of thousands of Syrians regularly worked as laborers in Lebanon.At a cafe sparkling with Christmas lights in West Beirut on New Year’s Eve, a crowd of middle-class, antigovernment Syrians danced to Arabic songs. (Some were beloved tunes by pop stars who have emerged during the war as government supporters, but when it came to music, culture and nostalgia trumped politics.)The party’s host paused to wonder whether it would be the last such gathering in Beirut, which in addition to hosting many destitute refugees has also become a hub of Syrian artists, doctors and activists.“We don’t know if we will be here dancing next year,” he said. Asked where they might go, he said, “We have no idea.”The measure says Syrians must apply for one of several types of visas, such as student, business and transit, but refugee was not listed among them. Another route is to be sponsored by a Lebanese citizen.The Lebanese authorities have also begun to crack down on expired residency permits, anecdotal evidence suggests. There is political tension over the refugees, who are straining schools and hospitals, camping in farm fields and, because they are overwhelmingly Sunnis, threatening to upset Lebanon’s sectarian balance if they stay permanently.Refugees have a fraught place in Lebanese history: Palestinians who fled the war over Israel’s founding in 1948, and their descendants, remain in impoverished camps and were part of the volatile mix that set off the country’s long civil war a generation ago.Jordan has announced that it will no longer be able to provide health care for the 623,000 registered refugees on its territory, Mr. Redmond said. (The total number of Syrians in Jordan and Turkey, as in Lebanon, is believed to be much higher than official numbers.) And while the Jordanian government says it has not stopped unrestricted entry, in practice groups of refugees are periodically stranded in a no man’s land on the border, in one recent case for months.",2015-01-03T02:02:16+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/as-refugee-tide-swells-lebanon-plans-a-visa-requirement-for-syrians.html,1106,8
New York Times,"HONG KONG — Hong Kong health officials have slaughtered thousands of chickens from mainland China, closed one wholesale market and banned imports of live poultry after tests found some birds were infected with a strain of bird flu.The city’s secretary for food and health, Ko Wing-man, said that sales of all live chickens in Hong Kong might be banned if wholesalers do not step up measures to control bird flu, The South China Morning Post reported Friday. Earlier this week, the H7N9 strain of the avian influenza virus was found in some birds from a farm in Huizhou, in Guangdong Province in southern China.Many people in Hong Kong buy pork and poultry from wet markets, unrefrigerated open-air shops that sell freshly slaughtered animals. Much of the city’s food supply comes from farms in mainland China, though in the case of chickens, the supply is segregated from birds bound for mainland markets.Avian influenza outbreaks have not been confined to China. In recent weeks, Hong Kong has banned poultry imports from certain regions of Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada after bird flu strains were detected there. Last month one woman in Hong Kong became infected with the virus after she traveled to a wet market in mainland China.

New York Times,"New Year’s Day was to be a day of triumph and celebration for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. He was being sworn in for a second term not once but twice, in Manhattan and in Buffalo, with a stirring speech that heralded the accomplishments of his first term and laid out an aggressive agenda for the next four years.But even as Mr. Cuomo was being inaugurated in Buffalo, his father, Mario M. Cuomo, a former governor who was 82 and had listened to his son’s first speech from his home, died of heart failure — instantly commanding the attention not just of the state, but of much of a nation that once was fascinated by the elder Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic philosophy he represented. The sitting governor’s moment slipped to the side of the stage.It would be hard to imagine a more fitting confluence of circumstances involving these two arresting figures in national political circles — two Democratic governors whose relationship was complicated and competitive, filled with pride, admiration and love, but also marked by jealousy and rivalry. Theirs was a distinctly New York story — one that began when Andrew Cuomo, as a teenager and, later, a young man, helped in his father’s earliest political races and even shared an apartment in Albany with him.Realizing that Mario Cuomo would not be in the audience the next day, Governor Cuomo, 57, canceled the traditional New Year’s Eve swearing-in in Albany to be at his bedside. There, he read his father a draft of his inaugural speech in what both men surely realized would be one of their last moments together.“He said it was good — especially for a second-termer,” Mr. Cuomo said, recounting the moment as he offered a final insight into their relationship. “See? My father’s a third-termer.”The inaugural brimmed with warm references to Mario Cuomo, invoking his famous call to the “family of New York.” Andrew Cuomo echoed, even more than usual, the distinctive rise-and-fall cadences of his father (on the telephone, it could be nearly impossible to distinguish the two men).But perhaps most striking to people who knew them both, and realized the significance of what they were watching, Andrew Cuomo seemed to be championing his father’s generous view of the role of government — a surprise to many Democrats who thought that Mario Cuomo’s philosophy had not carried down to the next generation.“He gave an incredible speech — I am going to tear up here — with referencing his father and all his liberal values,” said Representative Nita Lowey, the New Rochelle Democrat who worked for Mario Cuomo when he was governor and who was at Thursday’s inaugural at the World Trade Center. “I felt his message was, ‘Pop: I am going to continue on what you are doing.' ”That said, Andrew Cuomo never wanted to simply continue what his father had done. At turn after turn, starting from when Mario Cuomo lost his bid for a fourth term as governor in 1994, Andrew Cuomo did things that friends said were intended to signal that he had learned from his father’s mistakes.Mario Cuomo had been criticized for neglecting upstate New York, so there was Andrew Cuomo bringing his inauguration to Buffalo. Mario Cuomo had been on the losing end of a battle with President Bill Clinton as Mr. Clinton moved the Democratic Party to the center and back to power in the early 1990s. Andrew Cuomo not only joined Mr. Clinton’s administration, but said — to his father’s chagrin — that he viewed Mr. Clinton as his mentor. And while Mario Cuomo failed to win a fourth term in part because of high taxes in the state, Andrew Cuomo worked with Republicans to cut them.Andrew Cuomo, in several interviews over the years, suggested that his father was more accomplished as a speech-giver than as a governor, and set out to build a record of achievement. In the process, he embraced the kind of compromise that rankled his father, in search of high-profile victories such as the legalization of same-sex marriage and more stringent gun-control laws.ImageMario M. Cuomo in 1982, during his first run as the Democratic candidate for governor of New York, with his son and campaign manager, Andrew, at campaign headquarters.Credit...William E. Sauro/The New York TimesAt one point, in 2011, Andrew Cuomo told Mario Cuomo directly in a telephone conversation that he was unimpressed with his own accomplishments as governor, saying he would not be satisfied with bland meat-and-potato victories like getting an austere budget passed on time, according to Democrats with direct knowledge of the conversation.“They are operational,” he told his father in dismissing such feats. By contrast, the son told the father, his push to pass same-sex marriage “is at the heart of leadership and progressive government.”Andrew Cuomo made a point, too, of undoing a large, if unwanted, part of his father’s legacy: building prisons. “I am proud that I’m going to go down in the history books as the governor who closed more prisons than any other governor in the history of the state of New York,” he said in November.For all that, there was probably no fiercer defender of Andrew Cuomo than Mario Cuomo, who could be brutal in attacking people who criticized Andrew Cuomo when he served as an adviser to his father in an office on the State Capitol’s second floor in the early 1980s.But over time, that protectiveness was mixed with disappointment, particularly when Andrew Cuomo’s first run for governor, in 2002, collapsed — in no small part, Mario Cuomo told his son and others, because Andrew Cuomo had not heeded his advice.The near-universal assessment of people who knew both men is that Mario Cuomo was the more cerebral thinker, and Andrew Cuomo the shrewder operative — his father’s campaign manager and, in the early years as governor, political enforcer. That characterization irritated both men, but it endured nonetheless.“While there was a competition in terms of record, there was an understanding between the two of them, from the very get-go, that one was the intellect and the other was the tactician,” said Wayne Barrett, a former reporter for The Village Voice who long covered the Cuomos.Theirs was a fraught relationship. Andrew Cuomo called his father “Mario,” not “Dad.” The two were as likely to communicate through the public forum of a newspaper interview — or through aides drafted into reluctant service — as, say, over the table at a family dinner.Mario Cuomo would make no secret of being upset when he saw his son drawing unkind comparisons between their records. Andrew Cuomo would grow angry when he read even the most oblique criticism of what he was doing from his father.Stylistically, the two men were very different. But as Andrew Cuomo built a record that Mario Cuomo never had, and embraced policies that it would be hard to imagine Mario Cuomo accepting, it was often unclear how much this was a matter of different ideology or just of expediency.“I think they are similar ideologically,” said Ms. Lowey. “But I think Andrew is pragmatic and determined how to figure out how to achieve his agenda.”Ken Sunshine, a public relations consultant who has advised both men for nearly 40 years, said that Andrew Cuomo had simply adjusted his style to accommodate a much different political and media environment than his father had confronted.“Comparing them is impossible — the times are totally different,” Mr. Sunshine said. “But they were, and are, brilliant for their times.”",2015-01-03T02:09:42+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/nyregion/one-last-confluence-for-mario-and-andrew-cuomo-proud-rivals.html,1235,1
New York Times,"MEXICO CITY — ERNESTO CARDENAL is a poet and a priest, a revolutionary and a mystic. His poetry speaks of Marilyn Monroe and Charles Darwin, of Spanish conquistadors and pre-Columbian gods. Science saturates his writing.“Science brings me close to God because it describes the universe and creation, and that brings me close to the creator,” said Nicaragua’s most prominent living poet in an interview a few weeks before his 90th birthday. “For me this is a prayer.”As he reaches the twilight of his life, Father Cardenal is being celebrated with a new anthology of his poems: “Ninety at Ninety.”Many of those works emanate from 20th-century struggles: a commitment to social justice rooted in faith and a fight for national sovereignty. The language may sound a little dated in English, but not in Spanish.“I am a revolutionary,” Father Cardenal declared with vigor. “Revolutionary means that I want to change the world.”He has been fighting for change since the 1950s, in an early aborted revolt against the brutal, kleptocratic Somoza dynasty, in his poetry and then as part of the left-wing Sandinista uprising in 1979 that overthrew Anastasio Somoza Debayle. He was long at odds with the Vatican hierarchy, staying faithful to the doctrine of liberation theology as Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI remade the Roman Catholic Church in their conservative mold. Long disillusioned by the Sandinistas, however, he is now an outspoken opponent.In Latin America, his denunciations of the prevailing order still ring true. “To close one’s eyes in the face of inequality and injustice would be absurd,” Sergio Ramírez, the Nicaraguan writer who compiled the anthology, wrote in an email. “One has a dual role which sometimes converts into just one: that of the writer and of the citizen.”“The writer who denounces, criticizes, rises up against power, defies the establishment” is a concept that is still very much alive in Latin America, Mr. Ramírez continued.FATHER CARDENAL is more reclusive these days, surrounded by science books at home in Managua. But public readings “sustain me,” he said.That was clear as he walked onto the stage of this city’s Palacio de Bellas Artes last month wearing a long poncho — not quite the white cassock of his early days as a priest — and his ever-present black beret to a rapturous reception from the audience.Sharing reflections before each poem, Father Cardenal drew a cloak of intimacy around what has been a very public life.There was the moment when he read of Marilyn Monroe’s death on a notice board at the seminary in Colombia, and the homage to Thomas Merton, the American monk and writer, who “revealed to me everything that was valuable of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.”He recalled the tranquillity of a boat ride back to the peasant community he had founded on the islands of Solentiname in Lake Nicaragua, and he repeated his wonder at the knowledge that all life evolved from a single cell.That fascination with evolution recurs through much of his later work. In the last poem in the anthology, “The Saga of the Third Chimpanzee,” Father Cardenal describes how speech distinguishes humans from the other primates, but in the final lines he makes a plea for humility.ImageTo Father Cardenal, who has been fighting for change since the 1950s, science shows why tyranny will ultimately crumble.Credit...Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times“The third chimpanzee has dominated earth/ the one that made Chartres and the Sistine Chapel/ and now begins to explore space/ he is speaking to the stars/ that have yet to respond/ has seen the birth of the Big Bang/ from which everything was born and he was born/ and like a baby with his mother/burst into babbling with God.”The laws of science are not just a source of awe and poetry to Father Cardenal. Their transformative force has a greater purpose. To illustrate what he meant, he repeated these lines from his 1989 “Cosmic Canticle,” an epic musing on the origin of the universe:“Biology also teaches:/ the peaceful animals are favored by selection/ The murderous groups in the same species do not prosper/ (Somozas, Pinochet, etc.)”TO Father Cardenal, science shows why tyranny will ultimately crumble.“We have to have hope that the world will change,” he elaborated. “And, going back to modern science, it has been shown, with the discovery of the Big Bang, the great explosion in which the whole cosmos was born, that we are in an incomplete universe. That is why there is evolution — because the universe is incomplete.”He has been consistent throughout his own evolution, but it has taken him to very different places.Born to a prosperous Nicaraguan family, Father Cardenal left at 18 to study literature, first in Mexico and then at Columbia University in New York, where he read Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson and Ezra Pound. After he returned to Nicaragua, in 1950, he opened a bookstore and followed the social pursuits of a well-born young man. But politics intruded. His poetry attacked the brutality of the Somoza dictatorship, and he joined an uprising in 1954, only to see its leaders captured and killed.He changed course suddenly in 1957, when he chose to enter the Trappist monastery at the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky, where he studied with Father Merton.From then on, wrote Mr. Ramírez in his introduction to the new anthology, Father Cardenal “would begin to live a deep religiosity which with time would carry him to the terrain of liberating mysticism and political commitment rooted in faith.”Ordained in 1965, he returned to Nicaragua and founded the community on Solentiname (pronounced so-LEN-teh-NAH-me), a model of liberation theology’s Marxist-infused commitment to the poor. It was razed by the government in 1977, but by then Father Cardenal had joined the Sandinistas. He became culture minister after their revolution prevailed two years later.Father Cardenal’s political role brought condemnation from the Vatican. Pope John Paul II pointed an angry finger at him as he knelt on the tarmac to receive the pontiff at the beginning of a visit to Nicaragua in 1983, a moment captured in a now-famous photograph. Two years later, the pope stripped him of his right to administer sacraments.ALTHOUGH he has praised the current pope, Francis, calling his arrival at the Vatican “a miracle,” he has not asked to have his priestly duties restored, saying that he does not need to return to those functions.Father Cardenal later became a critic of the Sandinistas for what he believed was a distortion of their cause. He continues to condemn the actions of President Daniel Ortega and has been a fierce opponent of the government’s project to dig a channel across the country that would presumably compete with the Panama Canal.“What would Sandino have done about the canal?” he asked the audience at the reading, referring to the revolutionary Augusto César Sandino, who fought the American Marines occupying Nicaragua in the 1920s.Considered in the sweep of history, the collapse of Nicaragua’s revolution barely seems to give him pause.“The Bible is full of revolutions. The prophets are people with a message of revolution,” he said. “Jesus of Nazareth takes the revolutionary message of the prophets. And we also will continue trying to change the world and make revolution. Those revolutions failed, but others will come.”To close the public reading here, Father Cardenal chose an elegy for a young peasant revolutionary from Solentiname who was killed in battle. One of its final lines reads, “I would like to die like you, brother Laureano.”Then he stood, raised his arms to applause and walked off the stage.",2015-01-03T02:16:03+0000,World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/americas/science-fuels-writing-and-faith-of-a-nicaraguan-poet-.html,1257,6
New York Times,"By today’s academic standards, the schoolwork stitched onto the 151 samplers that comprise the “Hail Specimen of Female Art! New Jersey Schoolgirl Needlework, 1726-1860” exhibition at Morven Museum and Garden here might not be A-plus-worthy. “One girl spelled Hanover ‘Hanovah,’ with an ‘ah’ on the end, like she had a New England accent,” said Elizabeth Allan, the museum’s curator of collections and exhibitions, during a recent tour. “There’s another girl named Joanna who spelled her name with three ‘n’s.” Regardless of those errors, the samplers discovered by Ms. Allan and her three co-curators during an eight-month search were most likely prized by the New Jersey families who once hung them. “In the 18th and 19th centuries, a sampler like this was an indication of social status,” said Ms. Allan, adding that needlepoint was a basic educational tool for girls in those years. “It meant you could afford to send your daughter to school.”The work to which she was referring, hung in one of five galleries given over to the exhibition and organized geographically, is a faded linen rectangle with silk stitching in shades of red, green and brown. Its creator, Emily Ryall of Trenton, was about 9 when she made it in 1821, according to research by Dan and Marty Campanelli, a couple from Quakertown who collect samplers and, along with Daniel C. Scheid, a collector from Princeton, assembled the show with Ms. Allan. The girls whose work is represented in the exhibition were typically between the ages of 8 and 16 when they were learning needlework, although one sampler on display was made by a 5-year-old. Miss Ryall’s piece is in the gallery devoted to works from Hunterdon, Mercer, Morris, Sussex and Warren Counties, alongside roughly 30 others, and is carefully stitched with both uppercase and lowercase letters. It shows large birds and a house with two chimneys, as well as a scattering of initials that most likely belonged to Ms. Ryall’s friends or siblings, Ms. Allan said. No errors are visible, though even if they were, Ms. Allan said, “the family probably would have hung it anyway, to show off the work.” The Morven exhibition is the first dedicated to the needlework of New Jersey schoolgirls. “At first we wanted to do a show of New Jersey quilts, but they were too big to hang and hard to display,” Ms. Allan said. “So someone said, ‘You know, I don’t think there’s been a show of New Jersey samplers.’ We were, like, ‘Really?’ ” ImageA sampler created by Anne Rickey in 1798, when she would have been about 15.Credit...Marty CampanelliWhat the show’s curators reaped once they began to look for antique needlework by schoolgirls was both plentiful and marked by a singularly regional quality, Ms. Allan said. “New Jersey samplers stand out from samplers from other states during the same time,” she said. “You can trace the designs of the teachers living in certain towns, and where they traveled.” The period covered by the show was defined by the distinctive designs. “We started with 1726 because that was the earliest known New Jersey needlework,” Ms. Allan said. “By 1860, you started to see a lot more store-bought patterns. Girls could have just gone out and bought or sent away for them. It was less girls and instructresses coming up with their own designs.” The title of the show is taken from the first sampler that visitors encounter when they enter the exhibition: a silk-on-linen rectangle roughly twice the size of a sheet of notebook paper, made in 1798 by Anne Rickey of Trenton, who was then about 15. Within a floral border and beneath three complete alphabets, Ms. Rickey stitched an eight-line verse that begins, “Hail specimen of female art” and ends with the words, “education forms the mind.”“Sometimes you can find the source for the verses,” Ms. Allan said. Religious and philosophical creeds, in addition to flowers, houses, trees, alphabets and names — the girls’ own and, often, those of their teachers, schools and family members — were among the common design elements. “We haven’t been able to find where Anne Rickey’s came from. It was most likely a creative teacher, or she might have come up with it on her own.” Though unable to pinpoint the origin of those lines, Ms. Allan became an expert at sleuthing sources for New Jersey samplers during her research. That, she said, was largely because of the efforts of her co-curators, all of whom have backgrounds in collecting. The Campanellis wrote a book on the subject, “A Sampling of Hunterdon County Needlework,” published by the Hunterdon County Historical Society in 2013.“We started by contacting every collector, museum and historical society we could find in New Jersey,” Ms. Allan said of the process. Families who had been storing ancestors’ samplers in their attics surfaced, and major dealers combed their records to unearth sales of New Jersey works. Those records led to the discovery of pieces that had made their way to Washington, California and other states over time. Museum inquiries turned up two works from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In all, Ms. Allan estimated, roughly half the samplers had come from private owners. Not all of New Jersey’s counties are represented equally. Burlington has its own gallery, for example, because of that county’s size and its Quaker history. Quakers “were known for valuing education,” Ms. Allan said. Reflecting on the lessons she herself learned in assembling the show, Ms. Allan said she was glad to have found proof that 18th- and 19th-century New Jersey girls “were active and creative and intelligent.”“But the sad part is, they didn’t have much of a voice,” she added. “In most cases, this is literally the only thing that remains of them.” ",2015-01-03T02:20:43+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/new-jersey-schoolgirl-samplers-like-a-stitch-out-of-time.html,944,11
New York Times,"His entire life, Ismaaiyl Brinsley tried on identities as if they were new clothes. He was a bad boy with a gun, a fashionable man in Gucci and Cartier, a T-shirt maker, a film director, a screenwriter, a devout Muslim, a rap producer. He had a nickname for every mood — Moses, Interstate, Palace, Gazava, Scorpio King, Bleau Barracuda. Online, he seemed to be screaming at people to pay attention. “Welcome To Greatness,” proclaimed a photo album on his Facebook page.In reality, Mr. Brinsley’s short life was a series of disappointments. He was the difficult teenager who was passed around from home to home, the adult who could make nothing work, not a T-shirt company, not even an attempt on his own life at a former girlfriend’s house. Everyone seemed to betray him. The friends who pistol-whipped and robbed him in May. The girlfriend who dumped him around Thanksgiving. In recent weeks, Mr. Brinsley was unraveling, increasingly desperate, the gap between the life he wanted at age 28 and the life he had looming ever larger. If he couldn’t get it together, he told the mother of his second child in early December, he would kill himself.On his last day, Dec. 20, he started out with that intention. He visited his former girlfriend Shaneka Thompson in suburban Baltimore. He pointed a silver Taurus 9-millimeter pistol at his head. Ms. Thompson talked him out of it, she would later tell the police, and then he shot her. Panicked and convinced that his life was now over, Mr. Brinsley decided to return to Brooklyn, the place he considered home. What he did next — shooting Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their patrol car, before killing himself — became the accelerant in what would become a major confrontation between a police union and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. The union has held the mayor partly responsible for the shootings, because of statements he made about those protesting the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown at the hands of police officers. Just hours before the shootings, Mr. Brinsley had posted on Instagram that he planned to kill two officers, citing the recent police killings of Mr. Garner in Staten Island and Mr. Brown in Ferguson, Mo.But the truth of Mr. Brinsley’s short life and violent end is probably less political and more accidental than initially portrayed, friends and his mother said. He was no ardent anti-police activist, as some of his friends were. He was nursing no grudge against the police in Brooklyn. He was no stone-cold criminal; his 20 arrests were mostly for minor crimes, even though they prevented him again and again from getting a job. He struggled with depression but had no history of hallucinations or other forms of psychosis, unlike his oldest brother, who battled schizophrenia. His version of Islam seemed more jumbled than jihadi. Instead, Mr. Brinsley seemed to be a grandstander at the end of his tether, homeless, jobless and hopeless. “I can’t even understand why,” Althea Hood, who had been a close friend of Mr. Brinsley since 2006 and saw him in Atlanta in early December at a recording studio, said of his death. “Other than, what he did in the beginning with his girlfriend might have been a mistake, and then he lost it.”Ultimately, that is perhaps the most coherent explanation: another wrong turn after a lifetime of them, one that led down a cul-de-sac where, in the end, Mr. Brinsley saw no way out. He decided to take two officers with him almost as an afterthought, a final attempt to gain the kind of notoriety that he had always craved. It was his final incarnation.Mr. Brinsley was born in Brooklyn, and he never let you forget it, calling people out for acting Brooklyn when he felt that they weren’t. But he was raised in Atlanta, where his parents moved when he was a boy. There, Mr. Brinsley was the youngest of four children brought up in the Senegalese Sufi branch of Islam embraced by his mother, Shakuwra Dabre.His parents broke up when Ismaaiyl was about 9, Ms. Dabre said. He became the generous child, the one who would pump gas at the nearby station for tips when money was tight, or who would bring his mother flowers. But he was also a handful. He learned that if he did poorly in school or acted out, his father came around. He acted out often. Ms. Dabre, struggling and broke, couldn’t handle him. So he bounced around: to his father’s, to a school in California, to New Jersey when his father moved there, to Atlanta with Ms. Dabre after he was sexually abused and tried to kill himself when he was about 14, to the apartment of a sister and her boyfriend, to a group home for troubled boys, to his sister again. Ismaaiyl learned to live on a couch. He was so estranged at times from his mother that she wasn’t certain where he went to high school. On social media, Mr. Brinsley claimed that he had graduated from Willingboro High School in New Jersey, but that doesn’t seem true. He was already in trouble in Atlanta. He appears in no Willingboro yearbooks from that time. On a court form, he said he had made it to the 10th grade.As an adult, Mr. Brinsley built his own family, mostly young men like him, living on the fringes and squatting where they could. He started having run-ins with police, small arrests for avoiding bus and subway tolls, or for defiance. “You just going to have to lock me up,” he told a transit police officer when he was 19, when the officer tried to get him to leave a bus in Atlanta.He became a hustler. Mr. Brinsley was a name-brand thief, accused of stealing things like a pair of rhinestone-studded women’s Fendi frames, a brown Gucci belt. Some he probably resold. A friend in South Beach, in Florida, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be linked to Mr. Brinsley after his crimes, said he had bought eyeglasses from him. “He always had a fresh pair,” the friend said.On Myspace, which he used when he was 21 and 22, Mr. Brinsley posted photographs of himself holding wads of cash, with a pistol tucked into his jeans, in an album called “Grown, Gorgeous And Gangsta.” He aspired to be a ladies’ man. Ms. Hood turned to Mr. Brinsley for support when she had breast cancer; he was the person who shared dinner with her at California Pizza Kitchen the night before her mastectomy. He dressed well, flirted well, presented himself well, even as he told a court that he was indigent. He had a daughter when he was 21, with a woman who wanted to be a model, three days after he stole the Gucci belt. “He was a real good dresser,” said Muller St-Cyr, a hip-hop artist from Brooklyn. “Like, the stuff he would wear, females would post on his Instagram, ‘Uh oh, Denzel Washington.’ Females, they were shocked. What was presented online was far from the reality. No one knew he was messed up the way he was messed up.”ImageAfter Shakuwra Dabre, Ismaaiyl Brinsley’s mother, and his father broke up when he was about 9, she said she struggled to raise him.Credit...Kirsten Luce for The New York TimesMr. Brinsley used social media to network, to figure out places to go, friends said. He went to Ohio, to Las Vegas, to Florida, mainly moving by bus, always looking for a place to stay. “He told me a story about how he stayed with a close friend in another state, but after a while, this dude kicked him out,” said the friend in South Beach, who let Mr. Brinsley stay with him on and off for a year. “It’s like this dude’s been kicked out of so many houses, it’s crazy.”Some of his long list of petty crimes were simply bizarre. In June 2009, he was arrested in Springfield, Ohio, after stealing a pair of scissors, a power inverter and some Trojan condoms from a Rite Aid. When a security guard confronted him, Mr. Brinsley ran to a nearby hotel. Police found him near the laundry room, trying to take out his braids.But other incidents highlighted his quick temper. By early 2010, Mr. Brinsley had been arrested twice for threatening women. He had allegedly threatened to kill one woman, then found her four days later and threw a drink at her. He threatened a Waffle House employee who asked him to leave, and tried to punch her.For the most part, his family was estranged. His mother was back in Brooklyn and rarely saw him. His father had little to do with him. “SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE A MOTHER-LESS CHILD,” he wrote on Facebook during this time. By 2011, he was on Twitter as the “Scorpio King.” His missives were aspirational (“Rise and grind! Another day, more dollars”); revealing (“I Almost Got Shot At Point Blank Range A Few Moments Ago”) and contradictory (“IN ALLAH I TRUST” followed by one mentioning “3 Condoms” and “I Love Myself!!!!”) For some reason, Mr. Brinsley was feeling angry. He sent threatening text messages to his sister Jalaa Brinsley in New York, the police said. On Twitter, he said he wished he could kill people and get away with it, then wrote “Take It In Blood Or Give It In Fear!” Days later, on June 6, 2011, Mr. Brinsley showed up at a friend’s place in Marietta, Ga., looking for a pair of sunglasses and a duffle bag. He ended up firing a bullet from a stolen gun at her gold Chevy Malibu, leading police on a foot chase and being Tasered and arrested near the Happy Mart convenience store. Despite this, his worst crime to date, the friend, Quione Williams, and her sister, Virginia Washington, said they liked Mr. Brinsley. Ms. Williams, who sometimes let Mr. Brinsley stay with her, described his social media bravado as “just stupid stuff.” The sisters said he seemed frustrated because he couldn’t get a job.“He’s trying to keep up with the Joneses, but he don’t have Joneses’ money,” Ms. Williams said.Even as he was being driven by the police to the station, Mr. Brinsley demanded attention. While sitting in the back of the squad car, he posted to his Facebook wall from his mobile phone, asking people to write him, if they ever cared. “I’m locked up right now, in Cobb County,” he wrote. “I’m looking at some serious time.”He was out in less than seven months, soon posturing again. “I’m a Reformed Thug.........Re-Formed,” he wrote on Twitter. While visiting the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, he wrote: “My God Comes First.........And Then My Gun.........”Yet Mr. Brinsley tried to get his life together: He started Minc & Co., which made T-shirts featuring drawings of naked women in various poses. The T-shirts didn’t work. Neither did another new company, My Local Breed, which aimed to sell polo shirts with a person’s home state emblazoned on the chest. Meanwhile, Mr. Brinsley kept piling up more debts, more responsibilities, like a second daughter, born to a woman in Brooklyn. He was robbed once or twice, friends said. In May, two people pistol-whipped him — one was an acquaintance, Ms. Washington said. It devastated him.“How would you feel if you went to someone’s house who you thought was your friend, and they happened to strip you and rob you?” said a friend in Atlanta, who asked to be identified only by his Instagram handle, Mike Summerz. “And then you get to see these people again. You are victimized and then you get to see the person that victimized you. Imagine that was happening all the time.” At some point, Mr. Brinsley met Ms. Thompson, an Air Force reservist who at the time worked for a Veterans Affairs hospital in North Carolina. He moved in with her, staying with her when she moved to a suburb of Baltimore, friends said. Ms. Dabre said her son liked the fact that Ms. Thompson let him roam around and visit his usual haunts. But he fell in love. She broke up with him, probably a couple of times, in August, the police said, and around Thanksgiving, Ms. Dabre said. Regardless, he kept a key. In recent months, Mr. Brinsley was upset about what happened to Mr. Brown and Mr. Garner, and he posted a picture of a flag burning on Instagram, urging his friends to do the same. “So Let’s Ruffle Some Feathers And Take It Into Our Own Hands And Make Them Watch In Horror As We Burn What They Represent,” he wrote in one post, retrieved by a friend and shown to The New York Times. But he never talked about wanting to hurt police officers, his friends said. Back in Atlanta after Thanksgiving, Mr. Brinsley saw Ms. Hood in the first part of December, counseling her over her own breakup. He didn’t mention his own. He said he was going home, to Brooklyn. At some point, Mr. Brinsley sat down for a meal with the mother of his younger daughter, Ms. Dabre said, adding that the woman later told her that Mr. Brinsley had threatened suicide.On Dec. 18, Mr. Brinsley saw some of his Atlanta friends, posing for Instagram pictures and sneering at the camera as one friend brandished a knife. Mr. Brinsley did not talk about hurting police officers or visiting his ex-girlfriend, said his friend known as Mike Summerz on Instagram. “I knew he had a lot on his mind,” the friend added. The next day, Ms. Dabre said she had a vision: her son walking into her apartment with a gun.Instead, Mr. Brinsley showed up the following day at Ms. Thompson’s apartment outside Baltimore, about 5:30 a.m., letting himself in with his key. After he shot her, Mr. Brinsley fled in a panic, catching the Bolt Bus to New York. As he sat on the bus, wearing camouflage pants and greenish tennis shoes spattered with blood, he called Ms. Thompson’s mother, apologized and said he had shot her daughter by accident. He called Jalaa Brinsley, his sister, and he called Ms. Dabre, whom he referred to as “ummi,” which means “mother” in Arabic. “It’s a wrap, Ummi,” Mr. Brinsley told her. “I already know it’s a wrap.”“I was shaking,” Ms. Dabre said. “I said, ‘Jalaa, I don’t like the feel of this.’ We were both shaking. I had a feeling he was heading this way.”She thought he was coming for her. Instead, he came for two police officers he had never met, in a city where he didn’t live, at the end of a life that never measured up. He posted his intentions on Instagram. Pay attention to me, he seemed to shout, even telling two young men he met in Bedford-Stuyvesant to follow him on Instagram and to watch what he did next, just before he shot two strangers.",2015-01-03T02:43:42+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/nyregion/ismaaiyl-brinsleys-many-identities-fueled-life-of-wrong-turns.html,2503,1
New York Times,"One sunny morning, John O’Donnell was making coffee when, from the corner of his eye, he was diverted by a ray of light glinting off a pan in his dish drainer. “I was shocked,” he said. “I spent more time than I ever had looking at my dish rack.”That incident was one of the inspirations for “New Media: John O’Donnell: Psychedelic Pantry,” in the New Media Alcove at the New Britain Museum of American Art. Mr. O’Donnell, a multidisciplinary artist in New Haven, has transformed the 56-square-foot space into a fantastical kitchen filled with hallucinatory video, gaudy food packaging and, yes, an illuminated dish rack. The installation highlights the unexpected, poignant and often overlooked occurrences that arise alongside the routines of daily life. “It’s a space where you have experiences that are not about the space at all,” Mr. O’Donnell, 33, said.The exhibition consists of the dish drainer, a countertop one might encounter in a dream, and displays in three wooden cabinet units with their doors flung open. One cabinet is mounted so high that even the artist, who is over 6 feet tall, cannot reach it. Visible inside is a wacky, hemispherical formation covered in Froot Loops, some sprouting plastic blossoms. ImageRainbow illumination from below changes the colors in a dish rack.Credit...Melissa NardielloOddities like these appear throughout “Psychedelic Pantry,” and Mr. O’Donnell, an assistant professor of printmaking at the University of Connecticut, was happy to expound on the conceptual premises behind them. The Froot Loops sculpture, he said, signifies the disorientation of “discovering something strange in a place where you know it doesn’t belong.” He called the feeling “domestic discombobulation” and indicated another source on the countertop across the alcove: an oversize coffee mug full of spray foam and cereal sitting on one of two stovetop burners. “You see things that you don’t remember doing but you realize you must have done,” he said. “I wanted to recreate that disconnect.”Observant visitors will notice circular mirrors beneath each burner and its false knob. “The mirrors allude to those glimmers and reflections that you catch in your peripheral vision,” Mr. O’Donnell said.There are more mirrors in the cabinet underneath, embedded in a narrow, cavelike environment with peaks of spray foam painted gold. “This represents an alternate reality,” he said, “like when you’re reaching for a colander but your mind is somewhere else.”As for the mirrors, he described them as “bits of metaphysical awareness.”“You might lean down to look into the cabinet and figure out who you really are,” he said.The drainer, placed on a white pedestal, holds a set of glass dishes. From below, a rainbow of oscillating colors shines through them, capturing the beauty of their changing glow. Mr. O’Donnell considers the piece a subtle commentary on class. “I’m taking this boring, ordinary dish rack and making it radiant and elegant,” he said.

The monitor is framed by snack food boxes adorned with maniacally enthusiastic characters promoting the contents, and bold graphics announcing unsettling combinations of flavors (think cheeseburger macaroni or pizza-flavored chips). The video is a collage of such foods: slow pans over photos of crackers and cookies, neon-colored cereals and goopy macaroni and cheese. The video’s theme, Mr. O’Donnell said, is the deception of consumers by manufacturers. He noted the message “Enlarged to show detail” on many of the boxes, with pictures of the products inside. “They’re tricking you based on the size of the food,” he said. He called it “texture seduction.” Mr. O’Donnell felt the lure of the package while selecting items to include. “I was thinking about which ones went well together,” he said. “I was making choices based on color and design, and then it struck me — this is what people do. They pick the foods they are going to eat based on what the packaging looks like.” Trolling the aisles of the grocery store, Mr. O’Donnell was well aware of the nutritional emptiness of the products he was buying. Their inability to satisfy is embodied in the haunting video soundtrack that pervades the installation, a never-ending note called a Shepard tone that seems to vary in pitch but doesn’t actually ascend or descend. “It could play for hours and you would never find a resolution,” he said. “Just like when you eat a bowl of Cocoa Puffs and you still feel hungry.”The New Media Alcove is part of the William and Bette Batchelor contemporary art gallery, and museumgoers might identify serendipitous connections between “Psychedelic Pantry” and some of the artwork on view nearby. Mr. O’Donnell was particularly taken by an untitled construction by Louise Nevelson hanging opposite his installation. “As I was setting up, I thought, ‘Wow, I can’t believe I’m so close to her work.’ ” He soon realized that she was stacking objects within rectangular forms not unlike his cabinets. “On some level it gave me permission to do the same,” he said.Whether or not visitors decipher all the reasons behind the decisions Mr. O’Donnell made when creating “Psychedelic Pantry,” the artist is pleased that his installation reinterprets a familiar household setting. “Usually when you go to a museum, you see oil paintings and bronze sculptures, and back at home, those things don’t exist,” he said. “Here people see a kitchen. And when they go home, there’s a kitchen there, too. Maybe they will look around and see the patterns and textures that exist in their lives. Maybe they’ll look differently at what’s really in their pantry.”",2015-01-03T02:43:59+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/new-media-john-odonnell-psychedelic-pantry-at-the-new-britain-museum-of-american-art.html,923,9
New York Times,"A shoe. A light bulb. A beer stein. An accordion. A concentration camp uniform.These are among the items that people have donated to the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County in Glen Cove. For the first time, they have been taken out of storage and assembled for an exhibition drawn entirely from the center’s archives. “Objects of Witness: Testimony From Holocaust Artifacts” tells stories through these objects, which are protected by glass. Photographs and texts accompanying the relics place them in historical and personal context.A bright red child-size accordion sits in one corner, surrounded by photos of a young Alex Rosner with the instrument and with his parents, Marianne and Henry, a renowned violinist. The accordion helped to save Alex Rosner’s life when he was in Auschwitz with his father, Mr. Rosner, now 79, said during a recent visit to the museum. Before that episode, Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than 1,000 Jewish lives during the Holocaust, employed him and his parents in a factory, which helped spare their lives, too. (Their story is depicted in the 1993 movie “Schindler’s List.”)But Alex and his father had to leave Schindler’s enterprise, Mr. Rosner said, because he was only 9 and was deemed too young to work. He might have been killed at the concentration camp, he said, but a female guard gave him the small accordion soon after he arrived. Later, young Alex — who already knew how to play the instrument — performed a duet with his father for a group of prison guards. “They were laughing,” he said. “They thought it was cute.” His father played for the guards on other occasions, and threatened to quit if harm came to Alex. “He used his violin to protect me,” Mr. Rosner said.

They reunited in Munich with his mother, who had continued to work for Mr. Schindler. “She arrived bearing the violin and the accordion,” he said. “How Schindler got them back, I don’t know.” Mr. Rosner, who lives in Long Island City, Queens, kept the accordion in his basement, he said, until he met Steven Markowitz, the center’s chairman, at a tennis club in Manhasset in 2014 and mentioned it. His father’s violin is on display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, he said, but he had never given much thought to his accordion. “I didn’t think it was a valuable asset,” he said.The center’s staff disagreed, said Beth Lilach, the senior director of education and community affairs and the show’s chief curator. Mr. Rosner’s childhood instrument joined hundreds of other artifacts in a storage room until another museum employee, Helen Turner, had the idea of displaying some of them. “We have so many things that are so powerful and so poignant that they deserve to be seen by everyone,” Ms. Turner said. Several items on view demonstrate how ingrained anti-Semitism was in German society for years before the Holocaust. A beer stein from about 1892 looks ordinary from a distance but includes stereotypical images and the text, in German, “Jews, get out of Germany!” ImageLeft: a worn leather child’s shoe that had been found near a gas chamber.

Her son, Lee Najman of Port Washington, said his mother, now 94 and residing in an assisted living community, often brought the jacket with her when she spoke in schools, synagogues and other locations. “It’s seen action,” he said. The jacket is in good condition because she acquired it toward the end of her four years of imprisonment and persecution by the Nazis. She was a slave laborer in an armaments factory and in labor camps in Poland before being deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she was again selected for slave labor. And then in 1945, she was sent on a death march that ended in Bergen-Belsen. After she was liberated, she and her husband, Emil, moved to Brooklyn and she became a teacher. A photograph shows her with one of her third-grade classes.The light bulb, decorated with a menorah on one side and a Star of David on the other, was found after the war in a 19th-century synagogue in Drama, Greece. It was discovered by Carl Gatenio, one of only 39 Jewish survivors from the town, which before the Holocaust had a Jewish population of 1,200. It was the only remaining object in the empty building, said Stella Gatenio, 89, who had met her future husband, now deceased, in a labor camp in Bulgaria. Mrs. Gatenio, who lives in Rockville Centre, said she had always cherished the bulb and gave it to her son and daughter-in-law, David and Rachel Gatenio of Woodmere, who displayed it in their home until about a year ago.That was when the younger Gatenios decided to donate a worn leather child’s shoe to the museum, and Stella Gatenio suggested sending the museum the bulb as well. The small shoe, whose owner is unknown, had been found in Birkenau near a gas chamber by Yaakov (Jackie) Handeli, a survivor who lives in Jerusalem. He asked the younger Gatenios, his friends, to place it in an American museum. The shoe, scuffed and squashed, is “an iconic image of the Holocaust,” Ms. Lilach wrote in a text, and “represents only one of an estimated 1,500,000 Jewish children and teenagers” killed during the Holocaust.The shoe, Ms. Turner said, is the object that gave her the idea for the exhibition: “You look at the shoe and you see everything.”",2015-01-03T02:51:20+0000,New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/helping-holocaust-artifacts-tell-their-stories.html,940,9
