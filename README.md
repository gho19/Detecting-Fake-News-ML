# DETECTING FAKE NEWS WITH ML

SI206 FINAL PROJECT
by Chase Goldman and Grant Ho

In today's online world, it can sometimes be difficult to discern whether the news you're reading is true or not. What if you had a model that could tell you if that Tweet you think is real is actually #FakeNews?

For this project, we'll be building a text classification model using the Naive Bayes classifier. Our data will come from the fake and real news dataset on Kaggle. By the end, we hope our machine learning model will be trained to detect whether or not various Twitter posts are legitimate or #FakeNews.
